from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ 14 generations
But this is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united
However because her husband Joseph was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle he intended to divorce her secretly
But after he had thought these things over look Jehovahs angel appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David do not be afraid to take your wife Mary home for what has been conceived in her is by holy spirit
She will give birth to a son and you are to name him Jesus for he will save his people from their sins
All of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet saying
Look The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son and they will name him Immanuel which means when translated With Us Is God
Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him and he took his wife home
But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son and he named him Jesus


After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king look astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem
saying Where is the one born king of the Jews For we saw his star when we were in the East and we have come to do obeisance to him
At hearing this King Herod was agitated and all Jerusalem with him
On gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born
They said to him In Bethlehem of Judea for this is how it has been written through the prophet
And you O Bethlehem of the land of Judah are by no means the most insignificant city among the governors of Judah for out of you will come a governing one who will shepherd my people Israel
Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the stars appearing
When sending them to Bethlehem he said Go make a careful search for the young child and when you have found him report back to me so that I too may go and do obeisance to him
After they had heard the king they went their way and look the star they had seen when they were in the East went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the young child was
On seeing the star they rejoiced with great joy
And when they went into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and falling down they did obeisance to him They also opened their treasures and presented him with giftsgold and frankincense and myrrh
However because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod they departed for their country by another way
After they had departed look Jehovahs angel appeared to Joseph in a dream saying Get up take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt and stay there until I give you word for Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him
So Joseph got up and by night took along the young child and the childs mother and went into Egypt
He stayed there until the death of Herod This fulfilled what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet saying Out of Egypt I called my son
Then Herod seeing that he had been outwitted by the astrologers flew into a great rage and he sent out and had all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts killed from two years of age and under according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers
Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet who said
A voice was heard in Ramah weeping and much wailing It was Rachel weeping for her children and she was unwilling to take comfort because they are no more
When Herod had died look Jehovahs angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
and said Get up take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for those who were seeking the life of the young child are dead
So he got up and took the young child and the childs mother and entered into the land of Israel
But hearing that Archelaus ruled Judea instead of his father Herod he was afraid to go there Moreover being given divine warning in a dream he withdrew into the territory of Galilee
And he came and settled in a city named Nazareth in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets He will be called a Nazarene


In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea
saying Repent for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
This in fact is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words A voice of one calling out in the wilderness Prepare the way of Jehovah Make his roads straight
Now John was clothed with camels hair and had a leather belt around his waist His food was locusts and wild honey
Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan were going out to him
and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River openly confessing their sins
When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism he said to them You offspring of vipers who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath
Therefore produce fruit that befits repentance
Do not presume to say to yourselves We have Abraham as our father For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones
The ax is already lying at the root of the trees Every tree then that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire
I for my part baptize you with water because of your repentance but the one coming after me is stronger than I am whose sandals I am not worthy to take off That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire
His winnowing shovel is in his hand and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him
But the latter tried to prevent him saying I am the one who needs to be baptized by you and are you coming to me
Jesus replied to him Let it be this time for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous Then he quit preventing him
After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water and look the heavens were opened up and he saw Gods spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him
Look Also a voice from the heavens said This is my Son the beloved whom I have approved


Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil
After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights he felt hungry
And the Tempter approached and said to him If you are a son of God tell these stones to become loaves of bread
But he answered It is written Man must live not on bread alone but on every word that comes from Jehovahs mouth
Then the Devil took him along into the holy city and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple
and said to him If you are a son of God throw yourself down for it is written He will give his angels a command concerning you and They will carry you on their hands so that you may not strike your foot against a stone
Jesus said to him Again it is written You must not put Jehovah your God to the test
Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory
And he said to him All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me
Then Jesus said to him Go away Satan For it is written It is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service
Then the Devil left him and look angels came and began to minister to him
Now when he heard that John had been arrested he withdrew into Galilee
Further after leaving Nazareth he came and took up residence in Capernaum beside the sea in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali
so as to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet who said
O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali along the road of the sea on the other side of the Jordan Galilee of the nations
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow light rose on them
From that time on Jesus began preaching and saying Repent for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
Walking alongside the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
And he said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers of men
At once they abandoned their nets and followed him
Going on from there he saw two others who were brothers James the son of Zebedee and his brother John They were in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them
At once they left the boat and their father and followed him
Then he went throughout the whole of Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people
And the report about him spread throughout all Syria and they brought him all those who were suffering with various diseases and torments those who were demonpossessed and epileptic and paralyzed and he cured them
Consequently large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan


When he saw the crowds he went up on the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him
Then he opened his mouth and began teaching them saying
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
Happy are those who mourn since they will be comforted
Happy are the mildtempered since they will inherit the earth
Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness since they will be filled
Happy are the merciful since they will be shown mercy
Happy are the pure in heart since they will see God
Happy are the peacemakers since they will be called sons of God
Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake
Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great in the heavens for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you
You are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its strength how will its saltiness be restored It is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men
You are the light of the world A city cannot be hid when located on a mountain
People light a lamp and set it not under a basket but on the lampstand and it shines on all those in the house
Likewise let your light shine before men so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens
Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets I came not to destroy but to fulfill
Truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place
Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens
For I say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens
You heard that it was said to those of ancient times You must not murder but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice
However I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court whereas whoever says You despicable fool will be liable to the fiery Gehenna
If then you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you
leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away First make your peace with your brother and then come back and offer your gift
Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent while you are with him on the way there so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge and the judge to the court attendant and you get thrown into prison
I say to you for a fact you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin
You heard that it was said You must not commit adultery
But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
If now your right eye is making you stumble tear it out and throw it away from you For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna
Also if your right hand is making you stumble cut it off and throw it away from you For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in Gehenna
Moreover it was said Whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce
However I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife except on account of sexual immorality makes her a subject for adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
Again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times You must not swear without performing but you must pay your vows to Jehovah
However I say to you Do not swear at all neither by heaven for it is Gods throne
nor by earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King
Do not swear by your head since you cannot turn one hair white or black
Just let your word Yes mean yes your No no for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one
You heard that it was said Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
However I say to you Do not resist the one who is wicked but whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other also to him
And if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment let him also have your outer garment
and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile go with him two miles
Give to the one asking you and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you
You heard that it was said You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy
However I say to you Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you
so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous
For if you love those loving you what reward do you have Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing
And if you greet your brothers only what extraordinary thing are you doing Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing
You must accordingly be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect


Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens
So when you make gifts of mercy do not blow a trumpet ahead of you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be glorified by men Truly I say to you they have their reward in full
But you when making gifts of mercy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you
Also when you pray do not act like the hypocrites for they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the main streets to be seen by men Truly I say to you they have their reward in full
But when you pray go into your private room and after shutting your door pray to your Father who is in secret Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you
When praying do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words
So do not be like them for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him
You must pray then this way
Our Father in the heavens let your name be sanctified
Let your Kingdom come
Let your will take place as in heaven also on earth
Give us today our bread for this day
and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
And do not bring us into temptation but deliver us from the wicked one
For if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you
whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses
When you fast stop becoming sadfaced like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so they may appear to men to be fasting Truly I say to you they have their reward in full
But you when fasting put oil on your head and wash your face
so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your Father who is in secret Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you
Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal
Rather store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal
For where your treasure is there your heart will be also
The lamp of the body is the eye If then your eye is focused your whole body will be bright
But if your eye is envious your whole body will be dark If the light that is in you is really darkness how great that darkness is
No one can slave for two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stick to the one and despise the other You cannot slave for God and for Riches
On this account I say to you Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing
Observe intently the birds of heaven they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses yet your heavenly Father feeds them Are you not worth more than they are
Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span
Also why are you anxious about clothing Take a lesson from the lilies of the field how they grow they do not toil nor do they spin
but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these
Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much rather clothe you you with little faith
So never be anxious and say What are we to eat or What are we to drink or What are we to wear
For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things
Keep on then seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you
So never be anxious about the next day for the next day will have its own anxieties Each day has enough of its own troubles


Stop judging that you may not be judged
for with the judgment you are judging you will be judged and with the measure that you are measuring out they will measure out to you
Why then do you look at the straw in your brothers eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye
Or how can you say to your brother Allow me to remove the straw from your eye when look a rafter is in your own eye
Hypocrite First remove the rafter from your own eye and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brothers eye
Do not give what is holy to dogs nor throw your pearls before swine so that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open
Keep on asking and it will be given you keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and it will be opened to you
for everyone asking receives and everyone seeking finds and to everyone knocking it will be opened
Indeed which one of you if his son asks for bread will hand him a stone
Or if he asks for a fish he will not hand him a serpent will he
Therefore if you although being wicked know how to give good gifts to your children how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him
All things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must do to them This in fact is what the Law and the Prophets mean
Go in through the narrow gate because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction and many are going in through it
whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life and few are finding it
Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheeps covering but inside they are ravenous wolves
By their fruits you will recognize them Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles do they
Likewise every good tree produces fine fruit but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit
A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit
Every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
Really then by their fruits you will recognize those men
Not everyone saying to me Lord Lord will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will
Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and perform many powerful works in your name
And then I will declare to them I never knew you Get away from me you workers of lawlessness
Therefore everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does them will be like a discreet man who built his house on the rock
And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house but it did not cave in for it had been founded on the rock
Furthermore everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand
And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in and its collapse was great
When Jesus finished these sayings the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching
for he was teaching them as a person having authority and not as their scribes


After he came down from the mountain large crowds followed him
And look a leper came up and did obeisance to him saying Lord if you just want to you can make me clean
So stretching out his hand he touched him saying I want to Be made clean Immediately his leprosy was cleansed away
Then Jesus said to him See that you tell no one but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses appointed for a witness to them
When he entered Capernaum an army officer came to him pleading with him
and saying Sir my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis and he is suffering terribly
He said to him When I get there I will cure him
The army officer replied Sir I am not worthy to have you come under my roof but just say the word and my servant will be healed
For I too am a man under authority having soldiers under me and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my slave Do this and he does it
When Jesus heard that he was amazed and said to those following him I tell you the truth with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith
But I tell you that many from east and west will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens
whereas the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
Then Jesus said to the army officer Go Just as you have shown faith so let it come to pass for you And the servant was healed in that hour
And Jesus on coming into Peters house saw his motherinlaw lying down and sick with fever
So he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began ministering to him
But after it became evening people brought him many demonpossessed ones and he expelled the spirits with a word and he cured all who were suffering
in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases
When Jesus saw a crowd around him he gave the command to depart for the other side
And a scribe came up and said to him Teacher I will follow you wherever you go
But Jesus said to him Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head
Then another of the disciples said to him Lord permit me first to go and bury my father
Jesus said to him Keep following me and let the dead bury their dead
And when he went aboard a boat his disciples followed him
Now look a great storm arose on the sea so that the boat was being covered by the waves but he was sleeping
And they came and woke him up saying Lord save us we are about to perish
But he said to them Why are you so afraid you with little faith Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and a great calm set in
So the men were amazed and said What sort of person is this Even the winds and the sea obey him
When he came to the other side into the region of the Gadarenes two demonpossessed men coming out from among the tombs met him They were unusually fierce so nobody had the courage to pass by on that road
And look they screamed saying What have we to do with you Son of God Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time
A long way off from them a herd of many swine was feeding
So the demons began to plead with him saying If you expel us send us into the herd of swine
And he said to them Go With that they came out and went off into the swine and look the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters
But the herders fled and going into the city they reported everything including the account of the demonpossessed men
And look all the city turned out to meet Jesus and when they saw him they urged him to depart from their region


So boarding the boat he traveled across and went into his own city
And look they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher On seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic Take courage child Your sins are forgiven
Now certain scribes said to themselves This fellow is blaspheming
Jesus knowing their thoughts said Why are you thinking wicked things in your hearts
For instance which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk
However in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic Get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
And he got up and went to his home
When the crowds saw this they were struck with fear and they glorified God who gave such authority to men
Next while moving on from there Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office and he said to him Be my follower At that he rose up and followed him
Later as he was dining in the house look many tax collectors and sinners came and began dining with Jesus and his disciples
But on seeing this the Pharisees said to his disciples Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
Hearing them he said Healthy people do not need a physician but those who are ill do
Go then and learn what this means I want mercy and not sacrifice For I came to call not righteous people but sinners
Then Johns disciples came to him and asked Why do we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast
At this Jesus said to them The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them do they But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast
Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment for the new piece pulls away from the garment and the tear becomes worse
Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins If they do then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined But people put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved
While he was telling them these things look a certain ruler who had approached did obeisance to him saying By now my daughter must be dead but come and lay your hand on her and she will come to life
Then Jesus got up and with his disciples followed him
And look a woman suffering for 12 years from a flow of blood approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment
for she kept saying to herself If I only touch his outer garment I will get well
Jesus turned around and noticing her said Take courage daughter Your faith has made you well And from that hour the woman was made well
When now he came into the rulers house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd making a commotion
Jesus said Leave the place for the little girl did not die but is sleeping At this they began to laugh at him scornfully
As soon as the crowd had been sent outside he went in and took hold of her hand and the little girl got up
Of course the talk about this spread into all that region
As Jesus moved on from there two blind men followed him shouting out Have mercy on us Son of David
After he had gone into the house the blind men came to him and Jesus asked them Do you have faith that I can do this They answered him Yes Lord
Then he touched their eyes saying According to your faith let it happen to you
And their eyes received sight Moreover Jesus sternly warned them saying See that nobody gets to know it
But after going outside they made it public about him in all that region
When they were leaving look people brought him a speechless man possessed of a demon
and after the demon had been expelled the speechless man spoke Well the crowds were amazed and said Never has anything like this been seen in Israel
But the Pharisees were saying It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons
And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity
On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd
Then he said to his disciples Yes the harvest is great but the workers are few
Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest


So he summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity
 verses divided into subverses in order to have names in new lines
The names of the 12 apostles are these
First Simon the one called Peter and Andrew his brother
James the son of Zebedee and John his brother
Philip and Bartholomew
Thomas and Matthew the tax collector
James the son of Alphaeus
Thaddaeus
Simon the Cananaean
and Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him

These 12 Jesus sent out giving them these instructions Do not go off into the road of the nations and do not enter any Samaritan city
but instead go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
As you go preach saying The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
Cure the sick raise up the dead make lepers clean expel demons You received free give free
Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your money belts
or a food pouch for the trip or two garments or sandals or a staff for the worker deserves his food
Into whatever city or village you enter search out who in it is deserving and stay there until you leave
When you enter the house greet the household
If the house is deserving let the peace you wish it come upon it but if it is not deserving let the peace from you return upon you
Wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off your feet
Truly I say to you it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city
Look I am sending you out as sheep among wolves so prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves
Be on your guard against men for they will hand you over to local courts and they will scourge you in their synagogues
And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them and the nations
However when they hand you over do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour
for the ones speaking are not just you but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you
Further brother will hand brother over to death and a father his child and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death
And you will be hated by all people on account of my name but the one who has endured to the end will be saved
When they persecute you in one city flee to another for truly I say to you you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives
A disciple is not above his teacher nor a slave above his master
It is enough for the disciple to become as his teacher and the slave as his master If people have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more those of his household
So do not fear them for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
What I tell you in the darkness say in the light and what you hear whispered preach from the housetops
And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna
Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value do they not Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Fathers knowledge
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered
So have no fear you are worth more than many sparrows
Everyone then who acknowledges me before men I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in the heavens
But whoever disowns me before men I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens
Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth I came to bring not peace but a sword
For I came to cause division with a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
Indeed a mans enemies will be those of his own household
Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me
And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me
Whoever finds his soul will lose it and whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it
Whoever receives you receives me also and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me
Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophets reward and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous mans reward
And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple I tell you truly he will by no means lose his reward


When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his 12 disciples he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities
But John having heard in jail about the works of the Christ sent his disciples
to ask him Are you the Coming One or are we to expect a different one
In reply Jesus said to them Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing
The blind are now seeing and the lame are walking the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news
Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me
While these were on their way Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed being tossed by the wind
What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft garments Why those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings
Really then why did you go out To see a prophet Yes I tell you and far more than a prophet
This is the one about whom it is written Look I am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way ahead of you
Truly I say to you among those born of women there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist but a lesser person in the Kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is
From the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press and those pressing forward are seizing it
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John
and if you are willing to accept it he is Elijah who is to come
Let the one who has ears listen
With whom will I compare this generation It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates
saying We played the flute for you but you did not dance we wailed but you did not beat yourselves in grief
Likewise John came neither eating nor drinking but people say He has a demon
The Son of man did come eating and drinking but people say Look A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine a friend of tax collectors and sinners All the same wisdom is proved righteous by its works
Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place for they did not repent
Woe to you Chorazin Woe to you Bethsaida because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes
But I say to you it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgment Day than for you
And you Capernaum will you perhaps be exalted to heaven Down to the Grave you will come because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sodom it would have remained until this very day
But I say to you it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day than for you
At that time Jesus said in response I publicly praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children
Yes O Father because this is the way you approved
All things have been handed over to me by my Father and no one fully knows the Son except the Father neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him
Come to me all you who are toiling and loaded down and I will refresh you
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am mildtempered and lowly in heart and you will find refreshment for yourselves
For my yoke is kindly and my load is light


At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat
At seeing this the Pharisees said to him Look Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
He said to them Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry
How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation something that it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat but for the priests only
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and continue guiltless
But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here
However if you had understood what this means I want mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless ones
For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath
After departing from that place he went into their synagogue
and look there was a man with a withered hand So they asked him Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath so that they might accuse him
He said to them If you have one sheep and that sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath is there a man among you who will not grab hold of it and lift it out
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the Sabbath
Then he said to the man Stretch out your hand And he stretched it out and it was restored sound like the other hand
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him
 beginning of the sentence moved from verse 15 to 16
Having come to know this Jesus departed from there
Many also followed him and he cured them all but he sternly ordered them not to make him known
in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet who said
Look My servant whom I chose my beloved whom I have approved I will put my spirit upon him and what justice is he will make clear to the nations
He will not quarrel nor cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the main streets
No bruised reed will he crush and no smoldering wick will he extinguish until he brings justice with success
Indeed in his name nations will hope
Then they brought him a demonpossessed man who was blind and speechless and he cured him so that the speechless man could speak and see
Well all the crowds were astounded and began to say May this not perhaps be the Son of David
At hearing this the Pharisees said This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Beelzebub the ruler of the demons
Knowing their thoughts he said to them Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin and every city or house divided against itself will not stand
In the same way if Satan expels Satan he has become divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand
Moreover if I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub by whom do your sons expel them This is why they will be your judges
But if it is by means of Gods spirit that I expel the demons the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you
Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man Only then can he plunder his house
Whoever is not on my side is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
For this reason I say to you every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
For example whoever speaks a word against the Son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the holy spirit it will not be forgiven him no not in this system of things nor in that to come
Either you make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten for by its fruit the tree is known
Offspring of vipers how can you speak good things when you are wicked For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things
I tell you that men will render an account on Judgment Day for every unprofitable saying that they speak
for by your words you will be declared righteous and by your words you will be condemned
Then as an answer to him some of the scribes and the Pharisees said Teacher we want to see a sign from you
In reply he said to them A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking a sign but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights
Men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at what Jonah preached But look something more than Jonah is here
The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon But look something more than Solomon is here
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through waterless places in search of a restingplace and finds none
Then it says I will go back to my house from which I moved and on arriving it finds the house unoccupied but swept clean and adorned
Then it goes and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself and after getting inside they dwell there and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first That is how it will be also with this wicked generation
While he was yet speaking to the crowds his mother and brothers were standing outside seeking to speak to him
So someone said to him Look Your mother and your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to you
In reply he said to the one who spoke to him Who is my mother and who are my brothers
And extending his hand toward his disciples he said Look My mother and my brothers
For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven that one is my brother and sister and mother


On that day Jesus left the house and was sitting by the sea
And such large crowds gathered to him that he went aboard a boat and sat down and all the crowd was standing on the beach
 verse divided into 2 subverses
 verse 3b merged into verse 4
Then he told them many things by illustrations saying
Look A sower went out to sow
As he was sowing some seeds fell alongside the road and the birds came and ate them up
Look A sower went out to sow As he was sowing some seeds fell alongside the road and the birds came and ate them up
Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep
But when the sun rose they were scorched and they withered because they had no root
Others fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them
Still others fell on the fine soil and they began to yield fruit this one 100 times more that one 60 the other 30
Let the one who has ears listen
So the disciples came and said to him Why do you speak to them by the use of illustrations
In reply he said To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of the heavens but to them it is not granted
For whoever has more will be given him and he will be made to abound but whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him
That is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations for looking they look in vain and hearing they hear in vain nor do they get the sense of it
And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in their case It says You will indeed hear but by no means get the sense of it and you will indeed look but by no means see
For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive and with their ears they have heard without response and they have shut their eyes so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back and I heal them
However happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear
For truly I say to you many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them
Now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed
Where anyone hears the word of the Kingdom but does not get the sense of it the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the one sown alongside the road
As for the one sown on rocky ground this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy
Yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled
As for the one sown among the thorns this is the one hearing the word but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
As for the one sown upon the fine soil this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it who really does bear fruit and produces this one 100 times more that one 60 the other 30
He presented another illustration to them saying The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field
While men were sleeping his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left
When the stalk sprouted and produced fruit then the weeds also appeared
So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him Master did you not sow fine seed in your field How then does it have weeds
He said to them An enemy a man did this The slaves said to him Do you want us then to go out and collect them
He said No for fear that while collecting the weeds you uproot the wheat with them
Let both grow together until the harvest and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up then gather the wheat into my storehouse
He presented another illustration to them saying The Kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his field
It is in fact the tiniest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the largest of the vegetable plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches
He told them another illustration The Kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations Indeed without an illustration he would not speak to them
in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said I will open my mouth with illustrations I will proclaim things hidden since the founding
Then after dismissing the crowds he went into the house His disciples came to him and said Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field
In response he said The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man
the field is the world As for the fine seed these are the sons of the Kingdom but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one
and the enemy who sowed them is the Devil The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things and the reapers are angels
Therefore just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things
The Son of man will send his angels and they will collect out from his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness
and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father Let the one who has ears listen
The Kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field that a man found and hid and because of his joy he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field
Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls
Upon finding one pearl of high value he went away and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it
Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering fish of every kind
When it was full they hauled it up onto the beach and sitting down they collected the fine ones into containers but the unsuitable they threw away
That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous
and will cast them into the fiery furnace There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
Did you get the sense of all these things They said to him Yes
Then he said to them That being the case every public instructor who is taught about the Kingdom of the heavens is like a man the master of the house who brings out of his treasure store things both new and old
When Jesus had finished these illustrations he departed from there
After coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works
Is this not the carpenters son Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas
And his sisters are they not all with us Where then did he get all of this
So they began to stumble because of him But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and in his own house
And he did not perform many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith


At that time Herod the district ruler heard the report about Jesus
and said to his servants This is John the Baptist He was raised up from the dead and this is why these powerful works are operating in him
Herod had arrested John and had bound him and imprisoned him because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother
For John had been saying to him It is not lawful for you to have her
However although he wanted to kill him he feared the crowd because they took him for a prophet
But when Herods birthday was being celebrated the daughter of Herodias danced for the occasion and pleased Herod so much
that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked
Then she at her mothers prompting said Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist
Grieved though he was the king out of regard for his oaths and for those dining with him commanded it to be given
So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison
His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl and she brought it to her mother
Later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him then they came and reported to Jesus
At hearing this Jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone But the crowds getting to hear of it followed him on foot from the cities
When he came ashore he saw a large crowd and he felt pity for them and he cured their sick ones
But when evening fell his disciples came to him and said The place is isolated and the hour is already late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food
However Jesus said to them They do not have to leave you give them something to eat
They said to him We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish
He said Bring them here to me
And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass Then he took the five loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven he said a blessing and after breaking the loaves he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
So they all ate and were satisfied and they took up the leftover fragments 12 baskets full
Now those eating were about 5000 men as well as women and young children
Then without delay he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore while he sent the crowds away
After sending the crowds away he went up on the mountain by himself to pray When evening came he was there alone
 measurements
By now the boat was many hundreds of metersyards away from land struggling against the waves because the wind was against them
But in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
When they caught sight of him walking on the sea the disciples were troubled saying It is an apparition And they cried out in their fear
But at once Jesus spoke to them saying Take courage It is I do not be afraid
Peter answered him Lord if it is you command me to come to you over the waters
He said Come So Peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward Jesus
But looking at the windstorm he became afraid And when he started to sink he cried out Lord save me
Immediately stretching out his hand Jesus caught hold of him and said to him You with little faith why did you give way to doubt
After they got up into the boat the windstorm abated
Then those in the boat did obeisance to him saying You really are Gods Son
And they crossed over and came to land in Gennesaret
On recognizing him the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country and people brought him all those who were ill
And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment and all those who touched it were made completely well


Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes saying
Why do your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times For example they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal
In reply he said to them Why do you overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition
For example God said Honor your father and your mother and Let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death
But you say Whoever says to his father or mother Whatever I have that could benefit you is a gift dedicated to God
he need not honor his father at all So you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition
You hypocrites Isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said
This people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far removed from me
It is in vain that they keep worshipping me for they teach commands of men as doctrines
With that he called the crowd near and said to them Listen and get the sense of it
It is not what enters into a mans mouth that defiles him but it is what comes out of his mouth that defiles him
Then the disciples came and said to him Do you know that the Pharisees were stumbled at hearing what you said
In reply he said Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted
Let them be Blind guides is what they are If then a blind man guides a blind man both will fall into a pit
Peter responded Make the illustration plain to us
At this he said Are you also still without understanding
Are you not aware that whatever enters into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer
However whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart and those things defile a man
For example out of the heart come wicked reasonings murders adulteries sexual immorality thefts false testimonies blasphemies
These are the things that defile a man but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man
Leaving there Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon
And look a Phoenician woman from that region came and cried out Have mercy on me Lord Son of David My daughter is cruelly demon possessed
But he did not say a word in answer to her So his disciples came and began to urge him Send her away because she keeps crying out after us
He answered I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
But the woman came and did obeisance to him saying Lord help me
In answer he said It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs
She said Yes Lord but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters
Then Jesus replied to her O woman great is your faith let it happen to you as you wish And her daughter was healed from that hour on
Departing from there Jesus next came near the Sea of Galilee and after going up on the mountain he was sitting there
Then large crowds approached him bringing along people who were lame maimed blind speechless and many others and they laid them at his feet and he cured them
So the crowd felt amazement as they saw the speechless speaking and the maimed being made sound and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the God of Israel
But Jesus called his disciples to him and said I feel pity for the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have had nothing to eat I do not want to send them away hungry for they may give out on the road
However the disciples said to him Where in this isolated place are we going to get enough bread to satisfy a crowd of this size
At this Jesus said to them How many loaves do you have They said Seven and a few small fish
So after instructing the crowd to recline on the ground
he took the seven loaves and the fish and after offering thanks he broke them and began giving them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
And all ate and were satisfied and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments
Now those eating were 4000 men as well as women and young children
Finally after sending the crowds away he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan


Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him and to test him they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven
In reply he said to them When evening falls you say It will be fair weather for the sky is firered
and in the morning It will be wintry rainy weather today for the sky is firered but gloomy You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but the signs of the times you cannot interpret
A wicked and adulterous generation keeps seeking a sign but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah With that he went away leaving them behind
Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take bread along
Jesus said to them Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
So they began to reason among themselves saying We did not take any loaves along
Knowing this Jesus said Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no loaves you with little faith
Do you not yet see the point or do you not remember the five loaves in the case of the 5000 and how many baskets you took up
Or the seven loaves in the case of the 4000 and how many large baskets you took up
How is it you do not discern that I did not speak to you about bread But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Then they grasped that he said to watch out not for the leaven of bread but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees
When he had come into the region of Caesarea Philippi Jesus asked his disciples Who are men saying the Son of man is
They said Some say John the Baptist others Elijah and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
He said to them You though who do you say I am
Simon Peter answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God
In response Jesus said to him Happy you are Simon son of Jonah because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you but my Father in the heavens did
Also I say to you You are Peter and on this rock I will build my congregation and the gates of the Grave will not overpower it
I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of the heavens and whatever you may bind on earth will already be bound in the heavens and whatever you may loosen on earth will already be loosened in the heavens
Then he sternly instructed the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ
From that time forward Jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised up
At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying Be kind to yourself Lord you will not have this happen to you at all
But turning his back he said to Peter Get behind me Satan You are a stumbling block to me because you think not Gods thoughts but those of men
Then Jesus said to his disciples If anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
Really what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life Or what will a man give in exchange for his life
For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he will repay each one according to his behavior
Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdom


Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves
And he was transfigured before them his face shone as the sun and his outer garments became brilliant as the light
And look there appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him
Then Peter said to Jesus Lord it is fine for us to be here If you wish I will erect three tents here one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah
While he was still speaking look a bright cloud overshadowed them and look a voice out of the cloud said This is my Son the beloved whom I have approved Listen to him
At hearing this the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid
Then Jesus came near and touching them he said Get up Have no fear
When they looked up they saw no one but Jesus himself
As they were descending from the mountain Jesus commanded them Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead
However the disciples put the question to him Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first
In reply he said Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things
However I say to you that Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but did whatever they wanted with him In this way also the Son of man is going to suffer at their hands
Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist
When they came toward the crowd a man approached him knelt down to him and said
Lord have mercy on my son because he is an epileptic and is ill He falls often into the fire and often into the water
I brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
In reply Jesus said O faithless and twisted generation how long must I continue with you How long must I put up with you Bring him here to me
Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was cured from that hour
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said Why could we not expel it
He said to them Because of your little faith For truly I say to you if you have faith the size of a mustard grain you will say to this mountain Move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you

It was while they were gathered together in Galilee that Jesus said to them The Son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands
and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised up And they were very much grieved
After they arrived in Capernaum the men collecting the two drachmas tax approached Peter and said Does your teacher not pay the two drachmas tax
He said Yes However when he entered the house Jesus spoke to him first and said What do you think Simon From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax From their sons or from the strangers
When he said From the strangers Jesus said to him Really then the sons are taxfree
But that we do not cause them to stumble go to the sea cast a fishhook and take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a silver coin Take that and give it to them for me and you


In that hour the disciples came near to Jesus and said Who really is greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens
So calling a young child to him he stood him in their midst
and said Truly I say to you unless you turn around and become as young children you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens
Therefore whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens
and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me also
But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him to have hung around his neck a millstone that is turned by a donkey and to be sunk in the open sea
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks Of course it is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes
If then your hand or your foot makes you stumble cut it off and throw it away from you It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire
Also if your eye makes you stumble tear it out and throw it away from you It is better for you to enter oneeyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Gehenna
See that you do not despise one of these little ones for I tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven

What do you think If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays will he not leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying
And if he finds it I certainly tell you he rejoices more over it than over the 99 that have not strayed
Likewise it is not a desirable thing to my Father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish
Moreover if your brother commits a sin go and reveal his fault between you and him alone If he listens to you you have gained your brother
But if he does not listen take along with you one or two more so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established
If he does not listen to them speak to the congregation If he does not listen even to the congregation let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector
Truly I say to you whatever things you may bind on earth will be things already bound in heaven and whatever things you may loosen on earth will be things already loosened in heaven
Again I tell you truly if two of you on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request it will take place for them on account of my Father in heaven
For where there are two or three gathered together in my name there I am in their midst
Then Peter came and said to him Lord how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him Up to seven times
Jesus said to him I say to you not up to seven times but up to 77 times
That is why the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves
When he started to settle them a man was brought in who owed him 10000 talents
But because he did not have the means to pay it back his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he owned to be sold and payment to be made
So the slave fell down and did obeisance to him saying Be patient with me and I will pay back everything to you
Moved with pity at this the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt
But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarii and grabbed him and began to choke him saying Pay back whatever you owe
So his fellow slave fell down and began to beg him saying Be patient with me and I will pay you back
However he was not willing but he went and had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed
When his fellow slaves saw what had happened they became greatly distressed and they went and reported to their master all the things that had happened
Then his master summoned him and said to him Wicked slave I canceled all that debt for you when you pleaded with me
Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you
With that his master provoked to wrath handed him over to the jailers until he repaid all that he owed
My heavenly Father will also deal with you in the same way if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart


When Jesus had finished speaking these things he departed from Galilee and came to the borders of Judea across the Jordan
Also large crowds followed him and he cured them there
And Pharisees came to him intent on testing him and they asked Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of grounds
In reply he said Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female
and said For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh
So that they are no longer two but one flesh Therefore what God has yoked together let no man put apart
They said to him Why then did Moses direct giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her
He said to them Out of regard for your hardheartedness Moses made the concession to you of divorcing your wives but that has not been the case from the beginning
I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery
The disciples said to him If that is the situation of a man with his wife it is not advisable to marry
He said to them Not all men make room for the saying but only those who have the gift
For there are eunuchs who were born that way and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs on account of the Kingdom of the heavens Let the one who can make room for it make room for it
Then young children were brought to him for him to place his hands on them and offer prayer but the disciples reprimanded them
Jesus however said Let the young children alone and do not try to stop them from coming to me for the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones
And he placed his hands on them and departed from there
Now look someone came up to him and said Teacher what good must I do to gain everlasting life
He said to him Why do you ask me about what is good One there is who is good If though you want to enter into life observe the commandments continually
He said to him Which ones Jesus said You must not murder you must not commit adultery you must not steal you must not bear false witness
honor your father and your mother and you must love your neighbor as yourself
The young man said to him I have kept all of these what am I still lacking
Jesus said to him If you want to be perfect go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come be my follower
When the young man heard this he went away grieved for he had many possessions
Then Jesus said to his disciples Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of the heavens
Again I say to you it is easier for a camel to get through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God
When the disciples heard that they were greatly astounded saying Who really can be saved
Looking at them intently Jesus said to them With men this is impossible but with God all things are possible
Then Peter said in reply Look We have left all things and followed you what then will there be for us
Jesus said to them Truly I say to you in the recreation when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life
But many who are first will be last and the last first


For the Kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard
After he had agreed with the workers for a denarius a day he sent them into his vineyard
Going out also about the third hour he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace
and to those he said You too go into the vineyard and I will give you whatever is fair
So off they went Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise
Finally about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing around and he said to them Why have you been standing here all day unemployed
They replied Because nobody has hired us He said to them You too go into the vineyard
When evening came the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge Call the workers and pay them their wages starting with the last and ending with the first
When the 11thhour men came they each received a denarius
So when the first came they assumed that they would receive more but they too were paid at the rate of a denarius
On receiving it they began to complain against the master of the house
and said These last men put in one hours work still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat
But he said in reply to one of them Fellow I do you no wrong You agreed with me for a denarius did you not
Take what is yours and go I want to give to this last one the same as to you
Do I not have the right to do what I want with my own things Or is your eye envious because I am good
In this way the last ones will be first and the first ones last
While going up to Jerusalem Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road
Look We are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes They will condemn him to death
and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake and on the third day he will be raised up
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons doing obeisance and asking for something from him
He said to her What do you want She replied to him Give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your Kingdom
Jesus answered You do not know what you are asking for Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink They said to him We can
He said to them You will indeed drink my cup but to sit down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father
When the ten others heard about it they became indignant at the two brothers
But Jesus called them to him and said You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them
This must not be the way among you but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister
and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave
Just as the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many
As they were going out of Jericho a large crowd followed him
And look two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out Lord have mercy on us Son of David
But the crowd rebuked them telling them to keep silent yet they cried all the louder saying Lord have mercy on us Son of David
So Jesus stopped called them and said What do you want me to do for you
They said to him Lord let our eyes be opened
Moved with pity Jesus touched their eyes and immediately they recovered their sight and they followed him


When they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives then Jesus sent two disciples
saying to them Go into the village that is within sight and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt with her Untie them and bring them to me
If someone says anything to you you must say The Lord needs them At that he will immediately send them
This actually took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said
Tell the daughter of Zion Look Your king is coming to you mildtempered and mounted on a donkey yes on a colt the offspring of a beast of burden
So the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them
They brought the donkey and its colt and they put their outer garments on them and he sat on them
Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road while others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road
Moreover the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept shouting Save we pray the Son of David Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovahs name Save him we pray in the heights above
And when he entered Jerusalem the whole city was in an uproar saying Who is this
The crowds kept saying This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee
Jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
And he said to them It is written My house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a cave of robbers
Also blind and lame people came to him in the temple and he cured them
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple Save we pray the Son of David they became indignant
and said to him Do you hear what these are saying Jesus said to them Yes Did you never read this Out of the mouth of children and infants you have brought forth praise
And leaving them behind he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there
While returning to the city early in the morning he felt hungry
He caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it but he found nothing on it except leaves and he said to it Let no fruit come from you ever again And the fig tree withered instantly
When the disciples saw this they were amazed and said How is it that the fig tree withered instantly
In answer Jesus said to them Truly I say to you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what I did to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain Be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will happen
And all the things you ask in prayer having faith you will receive
After he went into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said By what authority do you do these things And who gave you this authority
In reply Jesus said to them I will also ask you one thing If you tell me then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things
The baptism by John from what source was it From heaven or from men But they began to reason among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say to us Why then did you not believe him
But if we say From men we have the crowd to fear for they all regard John as a prophet
So they answered Jesus We do not know He in turn said to them Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things
What do you think A man had two children Going up to the first he said Child go work today in the vineyard
In answer this one said I will not but afterward he felt regret and went out
Approaching the second he said the same This one replied I will Sir but did not go out
Which of the two did the will of his father They said The first Jesus said to them Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God
For John came to you in a way of righteousness but you did not believe him However the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even when you saw this you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him
Hear another illustration There was a man a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad
When the fruit season came around he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit
However the cultivators took his slaves and they beat one up another they killed another they stoned
Again he sent other slaves more than the first group but they did the same to these
Lastly he sent his son to them saying They will respect my son
On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves This is the heir Come let us kill him and get his inheritance
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those cultivators
They said to him Because they are evil he will bring a terrible destruction on them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators who will give him the fruits when they become due
Jesus said to them Did you never read in the Scriptures The stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone This has come from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes
This is why I say to you the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits
Also the person falling on this stone will be shattered As for anyone on whom it falls it will crush him
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations they knew that he was speaking about them
Although they wanted to seize him they feared the crowds because these regarded him as a prophet


Once more Jesus spoke to them with illustrations saying
The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son
And he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast but they were unwilling to come
Again he sent other slaves saying Tell those invited Look I have prepared my dinner my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered and everything is ready Come to the marriage feast
But unconcerned they went off one to his own field another to his business
but the rest seizing his slaves treated them insolently and killed them
The king grew wrathful and sent his armies and killed those murderers and burned their city
Then he said to his slaves The marriage feast is ready but those invited were not worthy
Therefore go to the roads leading out of the city and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast
Accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all they found both wicked and good and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those dining
When the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight of a man not wearing a marriage garment
So he said to him Fellow how did you get in here without a marriage garment He was speechless
Then the king said to his servants Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be
For there are many invited but few chosen
Then the Pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in his speech
So they sent their disciples to him together with party followers of Herod saying Teacher we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth and you do not seek anyones favor for you do not look at the outward appearance of people
Tell us then what do you think Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not
But Jesus knowing their wickedness said Why do you put me to the test hypocrites
Show me the tax coin They brought him a denarius
He said to them Whose image and inscription is this
They said Caesars Then he said to them Pay back therefore Caesars things to Caesar but Gods things to God
When they heard that they were amazed and they left him and went away
On that day the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
Teacher Moses said If any man dies without having children his brother must marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother
Now there were seven brothers with us The first married and died and having no offspring he left his wife for his brother
The same thing happened with the second and the third through all seven
Last of all the woman died
So in the resurrection of the seven whose wife will she be For they all had her as a wife
In reply Jesus said to them You are mistaken because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God
for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage but they are as angels in heaven
Regarding the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was spoken to you by God who said
I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob He is the God not of the dead but of the living
On hearing that the crowds were astounded at his teaching
After the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they came together in one group
And one of them versed in the Law tested him by asking
Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the Law
He said to him You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind
This is the greatest and first commandment
The second like it is this You must love your neighbor as yourself
On these two commandments the whole Law hangs and the Prophets
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them
What do you think about the Christ Whose son is he They said to him Davids
He asked them How is it then that David under inspiration calls him Lord saying
Jehovah said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet
If then David calls him Lord how is he his son
And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him and from that day on no one dared to question him any further


Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples saying
The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses
Therefore all the things they tell you do and observe but do not do according to their deeds for they say but they do not practice what they say
They bind up heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger
All the works they do they do to be seen by men for they broaden the scripturecontaining cases that they wear as safeguards and lengthen the fringes of their garments
They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues
and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men
But you do not you be called Rabbi for one is your Teacher and all of you are brothers
Moreover do not call anyone your father on earth for one is your Father the heavenly One
Neither be called leaders for your Leader is one the Christ
But the greatest one among you must be your minister
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you shut up the Kingdom of the heavens before men for you yourselves do not go in neither do you permit those on their way in to go in

Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you travel over sea and dry land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him a subject for Gehenna twice as much so as yourselves
Woe to you blind guides who say If anyone swears by the temple it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is under obligation
Fools and blind ones Which in fact is greater the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold
Moreover If anyone swears by the altar it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gift on it he is under obligation
Blind ones Which in fact is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift
Therefore whoever swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it
and whoever swears by the temple is swearing by it and by the One inhabiting it
and whoever swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by the One sitting on it
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law namely justice and mercy and faithfulness These things it was necessary to do yet not to disregard the other things
Blind guides who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside they are full of greediness and selfindulgence
Blind Pharisee cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may also become clean
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you resemble whitewashed graves which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead mens bones and of every sort of uncleanness
In the same way on the outside you appear righteous to men but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you build the graves of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous ones
and you say If we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have shared with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
Therefore you are testifying against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets
Well then fill up the measure of your forefathers
Serpents offspring of vipers how will you flee from the judgment of Gehenna
For this reason I am sending to you prophets and wise men and public instructors Some of them you will kill and execute on stakes and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city
so that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar
Truly I say to you all these things will come upon this generation
Jerusalem Jerusalem the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to herhow often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings But you did not want it
Look Your house is abandoned to you
For I say to you you will by no means see me from now until you say Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovahs name


Now as Jesus was departing from the temple his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple
In response he said to them Do you not see all these things Truly I say to you by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down
While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples approached him privately saying Tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things
In answer Jesus said to them Look out that nobody misleads you
for many will come on the basis of my name saying I am the Christ and will mislead many
You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars See that you are not alarmed for these things must take place but the end is not yet
For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another
All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress
Then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name
Then too many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another
Many false prophets will arise and mislead many
and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will grow cold
But the one who has endured to the end will be saved
And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come
Therefore when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation as spoken about by Daniel the prophet standing in a holy place let the reader use discernment
then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains
Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house
and let the man in the field not return to pick up his outer garment
Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days
Keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the Sabbath day
for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the worlds beginning until now no nor will occur again
In fact unless those days were cut short no flesh would be saved but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short
Then if anyone says to you Look Here is the Christ or There do not believe it
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead if possible even the chosen ones
Look I have forewarned you
Therefore if people say to you Look He is in the wilderness do not go out Look He is in the inner rooms do not believe it
For just as the lightning comes out of the east and shines over to the west so the presence of the Son of man will be
Wherever the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered together
Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken
Then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
And he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity
Now learn this illustration from the fig tree Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves you know that summer is near
Likewise also you when you see all these things know that he is near at the doors
Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
Concerning that day and hour nobody knows neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son but only the Father
For just as the days of Noah were so the presence of the Son of man will be
For as they were in those days before the Flood eating and drinking men marrying and women being given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark
and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away so the presence of the Son of man will be
Then two men will be in the field one will be taken along and the other abandoned
Two women will be grinding at the hand mill one will be taken along and the other abandoned
Keep on the watch therefore because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming
But know one thing If the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into
On this account you too prove yourselves ready because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it
Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time
Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so
Truly I say to you he will appoint him over all his belongings
But if ever that evil slave says in his heart My master is delaying
and he starts to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards
the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know
and he will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his place with the hypocrites There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be


Then the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
Five of them were foolish and five were discreet
For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them
whereas the discreet took oil in their flasks along with their lamps
While the bridegroom was delaying they all became drowsy and fell asleep
Right in the middle of the night there was a shout Here is the bridegroom Go out to meet him
Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order
The foolish said to the discreet Give us some of your oil because our lamps are about to go out
The discreet answered saying Perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you Go instead to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves
While they were going off to buy it the bridegroom came The virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut
Afterward the rest of the virgins also came saying Sir Sir open to us
In answer he said I tell you the truth I do not know you
Keep on the watch therefore because you know neither the day nor the hour
For it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them
He gave five talents to one two to another and one to still another to each according to his own ability and he went abroad
Immediately the one who received the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more
Likewise the one who received the two gained two more
But the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his masters money
After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them
So the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents saying Master you entrusted five talents to me see I gained five talents more
His master said to him Well done good and faithful slave You were faithful over a few things I will appoint you over many things Enter into the joy of your master
Next the one who had received the two talents came forward and said Master you entrusted two talents to me see I gained two talents more
His master said to him Well done good and faithful slave You were faithful over a few things I will appoint you over many things Enter into the joy of your master
Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said Master I knew you to be a demanding man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow
So I grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground Here you have what is yours
In reply his master said to him Wicked and sluggish slave you knew did you that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow
Well then you should have deposited my money with the bankers and on my coming I would have received it back with interest
Therefore take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
For to everyone who has more will be given and he will have an abundance But the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away from him
And throw the goodfornothing slave out into the darkness outside There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be
When the Son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit down on his glorious throne
All the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
And he will put the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left
Then the King will say to those on his right Come you who have been blessed by my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world
For I became hungry and you gave me something to eat I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink I was a stranger and you received me hospitably
naked and you clothed me I fell sick and you looked after me I was in prison and you visited me
Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably or naked and clothe you
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you
In reply the King will say to them Truly I say to you to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
Then he will say to those on his left Go away from me you who have been cursed into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels
For I became hungry but you gave me nothing to eat and I was thirsty but you gave me nothing to drink
I was a stranger but you did not receive me hospitably naked but you did not clothe me sick and in prison but you did not look after me
Then they too will answer with the words Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you
Then he will answer them saying Truly I say to you to the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones you did not do it to me
These will depart into everlasting cuttingoff but the righteous ones into everlasting life


Now when Jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples
You know that two days from now the Passover takes place and the Son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest who was named Caiaphas
and they conspired together to seize Jesus by cunning and to kill him
However they were saying Not at the festival so that there may not be an uproar among the people
While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
a woman with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil approached him and she began pouring it on his head as he was dining
On seeing this the disciples became indignant and said Why this waste
For this could have been sold for a great deal of money and given to the poor
Aware of this Jesus said to them Why do you try to make trouble for the woman She did a fine deed toward me
For you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
When she put this perfumed oil on my body she did it to prepare me for burial
Truly I say to you wherever this good news is preached in all the world what this woman did will also be told in memory of her
Then one of the Twelve the one called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests
and said What will you give me to betray him to you They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces
So from then on he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him
On the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus saying Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover
He said Go into the city to Soandso and say to him The Teacher says My appointed time is near I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover
When evening came he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples
While they were eating he said Truly I say to you one of you will betray me
Being very much grieved at this each and every one began to say to him Lord it is not I is it
In reply he said The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will betray me
True the Son of man is going away just as it is written about him but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed It would have been better for that man if he had not been born
Judas who was about to betray him replied It is not I is it Rabbi Jesus said to him You yourself said it
As they continued eating Jesus took a loaf and after saying a blessing he broke it and giving it to the disciples he said Take eat This means my body
And taking a cup he offered thanks and gave it to them saying Drink out of it all of you
for this means my blood of the covenant which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins
But I say to you I will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father
Finally after singing praises they went out to the Mount of Olives
Then Jesus said to them All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about
But after I have been raised up I will go ahead of you into Galilee
But Peter in response said to him Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you I will never be stumbled
Jesus said to him Truly I say to you on this night before a rooster crows you will disown me three times
Peter said to him Even if I should have to die with you I will by no means disown you All the other disciples also said the same thing
Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane and he said to the disciples Sit down here while I go over there and pray
And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled
Then he said to them I am deeply grieved even to death Stay here and keep on the watch with me
And going a little way forward he fell facedown praying My Father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me Yet not as I will but as you will
He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to Peter Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me
Keep on the watch and pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation The spirit of course is eager but the flesh is weak
Again a second time he went off and prayed My Father if it is not possible for this to pass away unless I drink it let your will take place
And he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
So leaving them he again went off and prayed for a third time saying once more the same thing
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them At such a time as this you are sleeping and resting Look The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners
Get up let us go Look My betrayer has drawn near
While he was still speaking look Judas one of the Twelve came and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people
Now his betrayer had given them a sign saying Whoever it is I kiss he is the one take him into custody
And going straight up to Jesus he said Greetings Rabbi and gave him a tender kiss
But Jesus said to him Fellow for what purpose are you present Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody
But look one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest taking off his ear
Then Jesus said to him Return your sword to its place for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword
Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels
In that case how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way
In that hour Jesus said to the crowds Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching and yet you did not take me into custody
But all of this has taken place for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled
Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together
But Peter kept following him from a good distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and after going inside he sat with the house attendants to see the outcome
Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death
But they found none although many false witnesses came forward Later two came forward
and said This man said I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days
With that the high priest stood up and said to him Do you say nothing in reply What is it these men are testifying against you
But Jesus kept silent So the high priest said to him I put you under oath by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God
Jesus said to him You yourself said it But I say to you From now on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
Then the high priest ripped his outer garments saying He has blasphemed What further need do we have of witnesses See Now you have heard the blasphemy
What is your opinion They answered He deserves to die
Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists Others slapped him on the face
saying Prophesy to us you Christ Who struck you
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard and a servant girl came up to him and said You too were with Jesus the Galilean
But he denied it before them all saying I do not know what you are talking about
When he went out to the gatehouse another girl noticed him and said to those there This man was with Jesus the Nazarene
Again he denied it with an oath I do not know the man
After a little while those standing around came up and said to Peter Certainly you are also one of them for in fact your dialect gives you away
Then he started to curse and swear I do not know the man And immediately a rooster crowed
And Peter called to mind what Jesus had said namely Before a rooster crows you will disown me three times And he went outside and wept bitterly


When morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death
After binding him they led him off and handed him over to Pilate the governor
Then Judas his betrayer seeing that Jesus had been condemned felt remorse and brought the 30 pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders
saying I sinned when I betrayed innocent blood They said What is that to us You must see to it
So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed Then he went off and hanged himself
But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury because they are the price of blood
After consulting together they used the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for strangers
Therefore that field has been called Field of Blood to this very day
Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled And they took the 30 silver pieces the price that was set on the man the one on whom a price was set by some of the sons of Israel
and they gave them for the potters field according to what Jehovah had commanded me
Jesus now stood before the governor and the governor put the question to him Are you the King of the Jews Jesus replied You yourself say it
But while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders he made no answer
Then Pilate said to him Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you
But he did not answer him no not a word so that the governor was very surprised
Now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd whomever they wanted
Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Barabbas
So when they were gathered together Pilate said to them Which one do you want me to release to you Barabbas or Jesus the socalled Christ
For Pilate was aware that out of envy they had handed him over
Moreover while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent a message to him saying Have nothing to do with that righteous man for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas but to have Jesus put to death
In response the governor said to them Which of the two do you want me to release to you They said Barabbas
Pilate said to them What then should I do with Jesus the socalled Christ They all said To the stake with him
He said Why What bad thing did he do Still they kept shouting out all the more To the stake with him
Seeing that it did no good but rather an uproar was arising Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd saying I am innocent of the blood of this man You yourselves must see to it
At that all the people said in answer Let his blood come upon us and upon our children
Then he released Barabbas to them but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be executed on the stake
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governors residence and gathered the whole body of troops together around him
And disrobing him they draped him with a scarlet cloak
and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand And kneeling before him they mocked him saying Greetings you King of the Jews
And they spat on him and took the reed and began hitting him on his head
Finally after they had mocked him they stripped him of the cloak and put his outer garments on him and led him off to be nailed to the stake
As they were going out they found a man of Cyrene named Simon This man they compelled into service to carry his torture stake
And when they came to a place called iGolgothai that is Skull Place
they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink but after tasting it he refused to drink it
When they had nailed him to the stake they distributed his outer garments by casting lots
and they sat there keeping watch over him
They also posted above his head the charge against him in writing This is Jesus the King of the Jews
Then two robbers were put on stakes alongside him one on his right and one on his left
And those passing by spoke abusively of him shaking their heads
and saying You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days save yourself If you are a son of God come down off the torture stake
In the same way also the chief priests with the scribes and the elders began mocking him saying
Others he saved himself he cannot save He is King of Israel let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe in him
He has put his trust in God let Him now rescue him if He wants him for he said I am Gods Son
In the same way even the robbers who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him
From the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice saying iEli Eli lama sabachthanii that is My God my God why have you forsaken me
At hearing this some of those standing there began to say This man is calling Elijah
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it in sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink
But the rest of them said Let him be Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him
Again Jesus called out with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit
And look the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom and the earth quaked and the rocks were split
And the tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised up
and people coming out from among the tombs after his being raised up entered into the holy city and they became visible to many people
But when the army officer and those with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and the things happening they grew very much afraid and said Certainly this was Gods Son
And many women were there watching from a distance who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to minister to him
among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee
Now as it was late in the afternoon a rich man of Arimathea came named Joseph who had also become a disciple of Jesus
This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him
Joseph took the body wrapped it up in clean fine linen
and laid it in his new tomb which he had quarried in the rock And after rolling a big stone to the entrance of the tomb he left
But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary continued there sitting before the grave
The next day which was after the Preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate
saying Sir we recall what that impostor said while he was still alive After three days I am to be raised up
Therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day so that his disciples may not come and steal him and say to the people He was raised up from the dead Then this last deception will be worse than the first
Pilate said to them You may have a guard Go make it as secure as you know how
So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and posting a guard


After the Sabbath when it was growing light on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the grave
And look a great earthquake had taken place for Jehovahs angel had descended from heaven and had come and rolled away the stone and he was sitting on it
His appearance was like lightning and his clothing was as white as snow
Yes out of their fear of him the watchmen trembled and became as dead men
But the angel said to the women Do not be afraid for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was executed on the stake
He is not here for he was raised up just as he said Come see the place where he was lying
Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead for look he is going ahead of you into Galilee You will see him there Look I have told you
So quickly leaving the memorial tomb with fear and great joy they ran to report to his disciples
And look Jesus met them and said Good day They approached and took hold of his feet and did obeisance to him
Then Jesus said to them Have no fear Go report to my brothers so that they may go to Galilee and there they will see me
While they were on their way some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened
And after these had gathered with the elders and had consulted together they gave a considerable number of silver pieces to the soldiers
and said Say His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping
And if this gets to the governors ears we will explain the matter to him and you will not need to worry
So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day
However the 11 disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them to meet
When they saw him they did obeisance but some doubted
Jesus approached and spoke to them saying All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit
teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you And look I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things


The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ the Son of God
Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet Look I am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way
A voice of one crying out in the wilderness Prepare the way of Jehovah Make his roads straight
John the Baptizer was in the wilderness preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins
And all the territory of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River openly confessing their sins
Now John wore clothing of camels hair and a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey
And he was preaching Someone stronger than I am is coming after me the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie
I baptized you with water but he will baptize you with holy spirit
In the course of those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John
And immediately on coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being parted and like a dove the spirit coming down upon him
And a voice came out of the heavens You are my Son the beloved I have approved you
And immediately the spirit impelled him to go into the wilderness
So he continued in the wilderness for 40 days being tempted by Satan He was with the wild beasts but the angels were ministering to him
Now after John was arrested Jesus went into Galilee preaching the good news of God
and saying The appointed time has been fulfilled and the Kingdom of God has drawn near Repent and have faith in the good news
While walking alongside the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Simons brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea for they were fishermen
So Jesus said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers of men
And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him
After going a little farther he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John while they were in their boat mending their nets
and without delay he called them So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him
 verse 21 could be merged into 1 instead of 2 pieces
And they went into Capernaum
As soon as the Sabbath began he went into the synagogue and started to teach
And they went into Capernaum As soon as the Sabbath began he went into the synagogue and started to teach
And they were astounded at his way of teaching for he was teaching them as one having authority and not as the scribes
Just then there was a man in their synagogue who was under the power of an unclean spirit and he shouted
What have we to do with you Jesus the Nazarene Did you come to destroy us I know exactly who you are the Holy One of God
But Jesus rebuked it saying Be silent and come out of him
And the unclean spirit after throwing the man into a convulsion and yelling at the top of its voice came out of him
Well the people were all so astonished that they began to discuss it among themselves saying What is this A new teaching He authoritatively orders even the unclean spirits and they obey him
So the report about him spread quickly in all directions throughout the entire region of Galilee
At that they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew with James and John
Now Simons motherinlaw was lying down sick with a fever and they at once told him about her
Going to her he took her by the hand and raised her up The fever left her and she began ministering to them
After evening had fallen when the sun had set the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed
and the whole city was gathered right at the door
So he cured many who were ill with various sicknesses and he expelled many demons but he would not let the demons speak for they knew him to be Christ
Early in the morning while it was still dark he got up and went outside and left for an isolated place and there he began praying
However Simon and those with him hunted him down
and found him and they said to him Everyone is looking for you
But he said to them Let us go somewhere else into the towns nearby so that I may preach there also for this is why I have come
And he went preaching in their synagogues throughout the whole of Galilee and expelling the demons
There also came to him a leper pleading with him even on bended knee saying to him If you just want to you can make me clean
At that he was moved with pity and he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him I want to Be made clean
Immediately the leprosy vanished from him and he became clean
Then he gave him strict orders and at once sent him away
saying to him See that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things Moses directed for a witness to them
But after going away the man started to proclaim it a great deal and to spread the account widely so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into a city but he stayed outside in isolated places Yet they kept coming to him from all sides


However after some days he again entered into Capernaum and the word spread that he was at home
And so many gathered that there was no more room not even around the door and he began to speak the word to them
And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men
But they could not bring him right to Jesus because of the crowd so they removed the roof above Jesus and after digging an opening they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying
When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic Child your sins are forgiven
Now some of the scribes were there sitting and reasoning in their hearts
Why is this man talking this way He is blaspheming Who can forgive sins except one God
But immediately Jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves so he said to them Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts
Which is easier to say to the paralytic Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk
But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth he said to the paralytic
I say to you Get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
At that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all So they were all astonished and they glorified God saying We have never seen anything like this
Again he went out alongside the sea and all the crowd kept coming to him and he began to teach them
And as he was passing by he caught sight of Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office and he said to him Be my follower At that he rose up and followed him
Later he was dining in his house and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples for there were many of them who were following him
But when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors they began saying to his disciples Does he eat with tax collectors and sinners
On hearing this Jesus said to them Those who are strong do not need a physician but those who are ill do I came to call not righteous people but sinners
Now Johns disciples and the Pharisees practiced fasting So they came and said to him Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not practice fasting
So Jesus said to them While the bridegroom is with them the friends of the bridegroom have no reason to fast do they As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast on that day
Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment If he does the new piece pulls away from the old and the tear becomes worse
Also no one puts new wine into old wineskins If he does the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost as well as the skins But new wine is put into new wineskins
Now as he was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath his disciples started to pluck the heads of grain as they went
So the Pharisees said to him Look here Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath
But he said to them Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and the men with him were hungry
How in the account about Abiathar the chief priest he entered into the house of God and ate the loaves of presentation which it is not lawful for anybody to eat except the priests and he also gave some to the men who were with him
Then he said to them The Sabbath came into existence for the sake of man and not man for the sake of the Sabbath
So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath


Once again he entered into a synagogue and a man with a withered hand was there
So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath in order to accuse him
He said to the man with the withered hand Get up and come to the center
Next he said to them Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to kill But they kept silent
After looking around at them with indignation being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts he said to the man Stretch out your hand And he stretched it out and his hand was restored
At that the Pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of Herod against him in order to kill him
But Jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples and a great multitude from Galilee and from Judea followed him
Even from Jerusalem and from Idumea and from across the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing
And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him
Because he cured many all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him
Even the unclean spirits whenever they saw him would fall down before him and cry out and say You are the Son of God
But many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known
He ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him
And he formed a group of 12 whom he also named apostles those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach
and to have authority to expel demons
 verses divided into subverses in order to have names in new lines
And the group of 12 that he formed were
Simon to whom he also gave the name Peter
James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James he also gave these the name Boanerges which means Sons of Thunder
Andrew
Philip Bartholomew
Matthew Thomas
James the son of Alphaeus
Thaddaeus
Simon the Cananaean
and Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him

Then he went into a house
and again the crowd gathered so that they were not able even to eat a meal
 verses 191 and 200 merged  needed for presentation
Then he went into a house and again the crowd gathered so that they were not able even to eat a meal
But when his relatives heard about it they went out to seize him for they were saying He has gone out of his mind
Also the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying He has Beelzebub and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons
So after calling them to him he spoke to them with illustrations How can Satan expel Satan
If a kingdom becomes divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
and if a house becomes divided against itself that house will not be able to stand
Also if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided he cannot stand but is coming to an end
In fact no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man Only then can he plunder his house
Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak
But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin
He said this because they were saying He has an unclean spirit
Now his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent someone in to call him
As there was a crowd sitting around him they said to him Look Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you
But he replied to them Who are my mother and my brothers
Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said See my mother and my brothers
Whoever does the will of God this one is my brother and sister and mother


Again he began teaching beside the sea and a very large crowd gathered near him So he went aboard a boat and sat in it away from the shore but the whole crowd was next to the sea along the shore
And he began to teach them many things with illustrations and while he was teaching he said to them
Listen Look The sower went out to sow
As he was sowing some seeds fell alongside the road and the birds came and ate them up
Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep
But when the sun rose they were scorched and they withered because they had no root
Other seeds fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them and they yielded no fruit
But others fell on the fine soil and growing up and increasing they began to yield fruit and they were bearing 30 60 and 100 times more
Then he added Let the one who has ears to listen listen
Now when he was alone those around him with the Twelve began questioning him about the illustrations
He said to them To you the sacred secret of the Kingdom of God has been given but to those outside all things are in illustrations
so that though looking they may look and still not see and though hearing they may hear and still not get the sense of it nor will they ever turn back and receive forgiveness
Further he said to them You do not know this illustration so how will you understand all the other illustrations
The sower sows the word
These then are the ones alongside the road where the word is sown but as soon as they have heard it Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them
Likewise these are the ones sown on rocky ground as soon as they have heard the word they accept it with joy
Yet they have no root in themselves but they continue for a time then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word they are stumbled
There are still others that are sown among the thorns These are the ones who have heard the word
but the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches and the desires for everything else make inroads and choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
Finally the ones that were sown on the fine soil are those who listen to the word and favorably receive it and bear fruit30 60 and 100 times more
He also said to them A lamp is not brought out to be put under a basket or under a bed is it Is it not brought out to be put on a lampstand
For there is nothing hidden that will not be exposed nothing is carefully concealed that will not come out in the open
Whoever has ears to listen let him listen
He further said to them Pay attention to what you are hearing With the measure that you are measuring out you will have it measured out to you yes you will have more added to you
For whoever has will have more given to him but whoever does not have even what he has will be taken away from him
So he went on to say In this way the Kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground
He sleeps at night and rises up by day and the seeds sprout and grow talljust how he does not know
On its own the ground bears fruit gradually first the stalk then the head finally the full grain in the head
But as soon as the crop permits it he thrusts in the sickle because the harvesttime has come
And he went on to say With what can we compare the Kingdom of God or with what illustration can we explain it
It is like a mustard grain which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds on the earth
But when it has been sown it grows and becomes greater than all other vegetable plants and produces great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow
With many illustrations of that sort he spoke the word to them to the extent that they were able to listen
Indeed without an illustration he would not speak to them but he would explain all things privately to his disciples
And on that day when evening had fallen he said to them Let us cross to the other shore
So after they had dismissed the crowd they took him in the boat just as he was and there were other boats with him
Now a great violent windstorm broke out and the waves kept crashing into the boat so that the boat was close to being swamped
But he was in the stern sleeping on the pillow So they woke him up and said to him Teacher do you not care that we are about to perish
With that he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea Hush Be quiet And the wind abated and a great calm set in
So he said to them Why are you so afraid Do you not yet have any faith
But they felt an unusual fear and they said to one another Who really is this Even the wind and the sea obey him


Then they came to the other side of the sea into the region of the Gerasenes
And immediately after Jesus got out of the boat a man under the power of an unclean spirit met him from among the tombs
His haunt was among the tombs and up to that time absolutely no one was able to bind him securely even with a chain
He had often been bound with fetters and chains but he snapped the chains apart and smashed the fetters and nobody had the strength to subdue him
And continually night and day he was crying out in the tombs and in the mountains and slashing himself with stones
But on catching sight of Jesus from a distance he ran and bowed down to him
Then he cried out with a loud voice What have I to do with you Jesus Son of the Most High God I put you under oath by God not to torment me
For Jesus had been saying to it Come out of the man you unclean spirit
But Jesus asked him What is your name And he replied My name is Legion because there are many of us
And he kept pleading with Jesus not to send the spirits out of the country
Now a great herd of swine was feeding there at the mountain
So the spirits pleaded with him Send us into the swine so that we may enter into them
And he gave them permission With that the unclean spirits came out and went into the swine and the herd rushed over the precipice into the sea about 2000 of them and were drowned in the sea
But their herders fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside and people came to see what had happened
So they came to Jesus and saw the demonpossessed man the one who previously had the Legion sitting clothed and in his right mind and they grew fearful
Also those who had seen it related to them how this had happened to the demonpossessed man and the swine
So they began to plead with Jesus to go away from their region
Now as he was boarding the boat the man who had been demonpossessed pleaded to go with him
However he did not let him but said to him Go home to your relatives and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he has shown you
This man went away and started to proclaim in the Decapolis all the things Jesus had done for him and all the people were amazed
After Jesus had crossed again by boat to the opposite shore a large crowd gathered together to him and he was by the sea
One of the presiding officers of the synagogue named Jairus now came and on catching sight of him he fell at his feet
He pleaded with him many times saying My little daughter is extremely ill Please come and put your hands on her so that she may get well and live
At that Jesus went with him and a large crowd was following him and pressing against him
Now there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years
She had suffered much at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources and she was no better but rather had become worse
When she heard the reports about Jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment
for she kept saying If I touch just his outer garments I will get well
And immediately her flow of blood dried up and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness
Immediately Jesus realized in himself that power had gone out of him and he turned around in the crowd and asked Who touched my outer garments
But his disciples said to him You see the crowd pressing in on you and you ask Who touched me
However he was looking around to see who had done this
The woman frightened and trembling knowing what had happened to her came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth
He said to her Daughter your faith has made you well Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness
While he was yet speaking some men from the home of the presiding officer of the synagogue came and said Your daughter died Why bother the Teacher any longer
But Jesus overheard their words and said to the presiding officer of the synagogue Have no fear only exercise faith
Now he did not let anyone follow him except Peter James and John the brother of James
So they came to the house of the presiding officer of the synagogue and he saw the commotion and those weeping and wailing loudly
After stepping in he said to them Why are you weeping and causing this commotion The child has not died but is sleeping
At this they began to laugh at him scornfully But after sending them all outside he took the childs father and mother and those with him and he went in where the child was
Then taking the hand of the child he said to her iTalitha cumii which when translated means Little girl I say to you Get up
And immediately the girl rose and began walking She was 12 years old And at once they were beside themselves with great ecstasy
But he ordered them again and again to let no one learn of this and he said that something should be given her to eat


He departed from there and came into his home territory and his disciples followed him
When it was the Sabbath he started teaching in the synagogue and most who heard him were astounded and said Where did this man get these things And why should this wisdom have been given to him and such powerful works be performed through his hands
This is the carpenter the son of Mary and the brother of James Joseph Judas and Simon is it not And his sisters are here with us are they not So they began to stumble because of him
But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and among his relatives and in his own house
So he was not able to do any powerful work there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them
Indeed he was amazed at their lack of faith And he went around in a circuit to the villages teaching
He now summoned the Twelve and started sending them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
Also he gave them orders to carry nothing for the trip except a staffno bread no food pouch no money in their belts
but to put on sandals and not to wear two garments
Further he said to them Wherever you enter into a home stay there until you leave that place
And wherever a place will not receive you or listen to you on going out from there shake off the dirt that is on your feet for a witness to them
Then they set out and preached that people should repent
and they expelled many demons and greased many sick people with oil and cured them
Now King Herod heard of this for the name of Jesus became wellknown and people were saying John the Baptizer has been raised up from the dead and that is why the powerful works are operating in him
But others were saying It is Elijah Still others were saying It is a prophet like one of the prophets of old
But when Herod heard it he said The John whom I beheaded this one has been raised up
For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother because he had married her
For John had been saying to Herod It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
So Herodias was nursing a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but she could not
For Herod was in fear of John knowing him to be a righteous and holy man and he was keeping him safe After hearing him he was at a great loss as to what to do yet he continued to hear him gladly
But a convenient day arrived when Herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of Galilee
And the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those dining with him The king said to the girl Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you
Yes he swore to her Whatever you ask me for I will give it to you up to half my kingdom
So she went out and said to her mother What should I ask for She said The head of John the Baptizer
She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request saying I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist
Although this deeply grieved him the king did not want to disregard her request because of his oaths and his guests
So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring Johns head So he went off and beheaded him in the prison
and brought his head on a platter He gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
When his disciples heard of it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb
The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught
And he said to them Come you yourselves privately into an isolated place and rest up a little For there were many coming and going and they had no leisure time even to eat a meal
So they set off in the boat for an isolated place to be by themselves
But people saw them going and many got to know it and from all the cities they ran together on foot and got there ahead of them
Well on getting out he saw a large crowd and he was moved with pity for them because they were as sheep without a shepherd And he started to teach them many things
By now the hour had grown late and his disciples came up to him and said This place is isolated and the hour is already late
Send them away so that they may go off into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat
He replied to them You give them something to eat At this they said to him Should we go off and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to the people to eat
He said to them How many loaves do you have Go see After finding out they said Five besides two fish
And he instructed all the people to recline in groups on the green grass
So they reclined in groups of 100 and of 50
Taking now the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing Then he broke the loaves up and began giving them to the disciples to place them before the people and he divided up the two fish for all
So they all ate and were satisfied
and they took up 12 baskets full of fragments aside from the fish
Those who ate the loaves were 5000 men
Then without delay he made his disciples board the boat and go on ahead to the opposite shore toward Bethsaida while he himself sent the crowd away
But after saying goodbye to them he went to a mountain to pray
When evening had fallen the boat was in the middle of the sea but he was alone on the land
So when he saw them struggling to row for the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came toward them walking on the sea but he was inclined to pass them by
On catching sight of him walking on the sea they thought It is an apparition And they cried out
For they all saw him and were troubled But immediately he spoke to them and said Take courage It is I do not be afraid
Then he got up into the boat with them and the wind abated At this they were utterly amazed
for they had not grasped the meaning of the loaves but their hearts continued dull in understanding
When they got across to land they came to Gennesaret and anchored the boat nearby
But as soon as they got out of the boat people recognized him
They ran around all that region and started to bring on stretchers those who were ailing to where they heard he was
And wherever he would enter into villages or cities or the countryside they would place the sick ones in the marketplaces and they would plead with him that they might touch just the fringe of his outer garment And all those who touched it were made well


Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him
And they saw some of his disciples eat their meal with defiled hands that is unwashed ones
For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow clinging to the tradition of the men of former times
and when they come from the market they do not eat unless they wash themselves There are many other traditions that they have received and cling to such as baptisms of cups pitchers and copper vessels
So these Pharisees and scribes asked him Why do your disciples not observe the tradition of the men of former times but they eat their meal with defiled hands
He said to them Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites as it is written This people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far removed from me
It is in vain that they keep worshipping me for they teach commands of men as doctrines
You let go of the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men
Further he said to them You skillfully disregard the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition
For example Moses said Honor your father and your mother and Let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death
But you say If a man says to his father or his mother Whatever I have that could benefit you is corban that is a gift dedicated to God
you no longer let him do a single thing for his father or his mother
Thus you make the word of God invalid by your tradition that you have handed down And you do many things like this
So calling the crowd to him again he said to them Listen to me all of you and understand the meaning
Nothing from outside a man that enters into him can defile him but the things that come out of a man are the things that defile him

Now when he had entered a house away from the crowd his disciples began to question him about the illustration
So he said to them Are you also without understanding like them Are you not aware that nothing from outside that enters into a man can defile him
since it enters not into his heart but into his stomach and it passes out into the sewer Thus he declared all foods clean
Further he said That which comes out of a man is what defiles him
For from inside out of the heart of men come injurious reasonings sexual immorality thefts murders
acts of adultery greed acts of wickedness deceit brazen conduct an envious eye blasphemy haughtiness and unreasonableness
All these wicked things come from within and defile a man
He rose up from there and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon There he entered into a house and did not want anyone to know it but he could not escape notice
Immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet
The woman was a Greek a Syrophoenician by nationality and she kept asking him to expel the demon from her daughter
But he said to her First let the children be satisfied for it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs
But she replied to him Yes sir and yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat of the crumbs of the little children
At that he said to her Because you said this go the demon has gone out of your daughter
So she went away to her home and found the young child lying on the bed and the demon was gone
When Jesus returned from the region of Tyre he went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee through the region of Decapolis
Here they brought him a deaf man with a speech impediment and they pleaded with him to lay his hand on him
And he took him aside privately away from the crowd Then he put his fingers into the mans ears and after spitting he touched his tongue
And looking up into heaven he sighed deeply and said to him iEphphathai that is Be opened
At this his ears were opened and his speech impediment was removed and he began speaking normally
With that he ordered them not to tell anyone but the more he would order them the more they would proclaim it
Indeed they were astounded beyond measure and they said He has done all things well He even makes the deaf hear and the speechless speak


In those days there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat So he summoned the disciples and said to them
I feel pity for the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have nothing to eat
If I send them off to their homes hungry they will give out on the road and some of them are from far away
But his disciples answered him From where will anyone get enough bread in this isolated place to satisfy these people
At this he asked them How many loaves do you have They said Seven
And he instructed the crowd to recline on the ground Then he took the seven loaves gave thanks broke them and began giving them to his disciples to serve and they served them to the crowd
They also had a few small fish and blessing these he told them to serve these also
So they ate and were satisfied and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments
Now there were about 4000 men Then he sent them away
Immediately he boarded the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha
Here the Pharisees came and started disputing with him demanding from him a sign from heaven to put him to the test
So he sighed deeply in his spirit and said Why does this generation seek a sign Truly I say no sign will be given to this generation
With that he left them got aboard again and went to the opposite shore
However they forgot to take bread along and they had nothing with them in the boat except for one loaf
And he warned them in no uncertain terms Keep your eyes open look out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod
So they began arguing with one another over the fact that they had no bread
Noting this he said to them Why do you argue over your having no bread Do you not yet perceive and understand Are your hearts still dull in understanding
Though having eyes do you not see and though having ears do you not hear Do you not remember
when I broke the five loaves for the 5000 men how many baskets full of fragments you collected They said to him Twelve
When I broke the seven loaves for the 4000 men how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up And they said to him Seven
With that he said to them Do you not yet understand
Now they put in at Bethsaida Here people brought him a blind man and they pleaded with him to touch him
And he took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside the village After spitting on his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked him Do you see anything
The man looked up and said I see people but they look like trees walking about
Again he laid his hands on the mans eyes and the man saw clearly His sight was restored and he could see everything distinctly
So he sent him home saying Do not enter into the village
Jesus and his disciples now left for the villages of Caesarea Philippi and on the way he began to question his disciples saying Who are people saying that I am
They said to him John the Baptist but others say Elijah and still others one of the prophets
And he put the question to them You though who do you say I am Peter answered him You are the Christ
At that he strictly ordered them not to tell anyone about him
Also he began teaching them that the Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and rise three days later
Indeed he was making that statement openly But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him
At this he turned looked at his disciples and rebuked Peter saying Get behind me Satan because you think not Gods thoughts but those of men
He now called the crowd to him with his disciples and said to them If anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will save it
Really what good will it do a man to gain the whole world and to lose his life
What really would a man give in exchange for his life
For whoever becomes ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels


Furthermore he said to them Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God already having come in power
Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves And he was transfigured before them
his outer garments began to glisten becoming far whiter than any clothes cleaner on earth could whiten them
Also Elijah with Moses appeared to them and they were conversing with Jesus
Then Peter said to Jesus Rabbi it is fine for us to be here So let us erect three tents one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah
In fact he did not know how to react for they were quite fearful
And a cloud formed overshadowing them and a voice came out of the cloud This is my Son the beloved Listen to him
Then suddenly they looked around and saw that no one was with them any longer except Jesus
As they were coming down from the mountain he strictly ordered them not to relate to anybody what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead
They took the word to heart but discussed among themselves what this rising from the dead meant
And they began to question him saying Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first
He said to them Elijah does come first and restore all things but how is it that it is written about the Son of man that he must undergo many sufferings and be treated with contempt
But I say to you that Elijah in fact has come and they did to him whatever they wanted just as it is written about him
When they came to the other disciples they noticed a large crowd around them and there were scribes arguing with them
But as soon as all the crowd caught sight of him they were astonished and they ran up to him to greet him
So he asked them What are you arguing about with them
And one of the crowd answered him Teacher I brought my son to you because he has a speechless spirit
Wherever it seizes him it throws him to the ground and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and loses his strength I asked your disciples to expel it but they were not able to do so
In response he said to them O faithless generation how long must I continue with you How long must I put up with you Bring him to me
So they brought the boy to him but at the sight of him the spirit at once threw the child into convulsions After falling on the ground he kept rolling about foaming at the mouth
Then Jesus asked the father How long has this been happening to him He said From childhood on
and often it would throw him into the fire and also into the water to destroy him But if you can do anything have pity on us and help us
Jesus said to him That expression If you can Why all things are possible for the one who has faith
Immediately the childs father cried out and said I have faith Help me out where I need faith
Jesus now noticing that a crowd was rushing toward them rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it You speechless and deaf spirit I order you get out of him and do not enter into him again
After crying out and going through many convulsions it came out and the child seemed to be dead so that most of the people were saying He is dead
But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he stood up
So after he entered into a house his disciples asked him privately Why could we not expel it
He said to them This kind can come out only by prayer
They departed from there and went through Galilee but he did not want anyone to get to know about it
For he was teaching his disciples and telling them The Son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands and they will kill him but despite being killed he will rise three days later
However they did not understand his statement and they were afraid to question him
And they came into Capernaum Now when he was inside the house he put the question to them What were you arguing about on the road
They kept silent for on the road they had been arguing among themselves about who is greater
So he sat down and called the Twelve and said to them If anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and minister of all
Then he took a young child and stood him in their midst and putting his arms around him he said to them
Whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name receives me also and whoever receives me receives not me only but also Him who sent me
John said to him Teacher we saw someone expelling demons by using your name and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us
But Jesus said Do not try to prevent him for there is no one who will do a powerful work on the basis of my name who will quickly be able to say anything bad about me
For whoever is not against us is for us
And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ I tell you truly he will by no means lose his reward
But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith it would be better for him if a millstone that is turned by a donkey were put around his neck and he were pitched into the sea
If ever your hand makes you stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to go off with two hands into Gehenna into the fire that cannot be put out

And if your foot makes you stumble cut it off It is better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with two feet into Gehenna

And if your eye makes you stumble throw it away It is better for you to enter oneeyed into the Kingdom of God than to be thrown with two eyes into Gehenna
where the maggot does not die and the fire is not put out
For everyone must be salted with fire
Salt is fine but if the salt ever loses its saltiness with what will you season it Have salt in yourselves and keep peace with one another


From there he got up and came to the borders of Judea across the Jordan and again crowds gathered to him As he was accustomed to do he again began teaching them
And Pharisees approached intent on testing him and they asked whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife
He answered them What did Moses command you
They said Moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her
But Jesus said to them Out of regard for your hardheartedness he wrote this commandment for you
However from the beginning of creation He made them male and female
For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother
and the two will be one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh
Therefore what God has yoked together let no man put apart
When they were again in the house the disciples began to question him about this
He said to them Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her
and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another she commits adultery
People now began bringing him young children for him to touch them but the disciples reprimanded them
At seeing this Jesus was indignant and said to them Let the young children come to me do not try to stop them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones
Truly I say to you whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it
And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them laying his hands on them
As he was going on his way a man ran up and fell on his knees before him and put the question to him Good Teacher what must I do to inherit everlasting life
Jesus said to him Why do you call me good Nobody is good except one God
You know the commandments Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor your father and your mother
The man said to him Teacher all these things I have kept from my youth on
Jesus looked at him and felt love for him and said One thing is missing about you Go sell what things you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come be my follower
But he grew sad at the answer and went away grieved for he had many possessions
After looking around Jesus said to his disciples How difficult it will be for those with money to enter into the Kingdom of God
But the disciples were surprised at his words Jesus then responded Children how difficult it is to enter into the Kingdom of God
It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God
They became still more astounded and said to him Who possibly can be saved
Looking straight at them Jesus said With men it is impossible but not so with God for all things are possible with God
Peter began to say to him Look We have left all things and followed you
Jesus said Truly I say to you no one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news
who will not get 100 times more now in this period of timehouses brothers sisters mothers children and fields with persecutionsand in the coming system of things everlasting life
But many who are first will be last and the last first
Now they were going on the road up to Jerusalem and Jesus was going ahead of them and they were astonished but those who followed began to fear Once again he took the Twelve aside and started to tell them these things that were about to happen to him
Look We are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes They will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations
and these will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him but three days later he will rise
James and John the sons of Zebedee approached him and said to him Teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you
He said to them What do you want me to do for you
They replied Grant us to sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
But Jesus said to them You do not know what you are asking for Can you drink the cup that I am drinking or be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized
They said to him We can At that Jesus said to them The cup I am drinking you will drink and with the baptism with which I am being baptized you will be baptized
However to sit down at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared
When the ten others heard about it they became indignant at James and John
But Jesus called them to him and said to them You know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them
This must not be the way among you but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister
and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many
They then came into Jericho But as he and his disciples and a considerable crowd were going out of Jericho Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus a blind beggar was sitting beside the road
When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene he started shouting and saying Son of David Jesus have mercy on me
At this many began rebuking him telling him to be silent but all the more he kept shouting Son of David have mercy on me
So Jesus stopped and said Call him to me So they called the blind man saying to him Take courage Get up he is calling you
Throwing off his outer garment he leaped to his feet and went to Jesus
Then Jesus said to him What do you want me to do for you The blind man said to him iRabbonii let me recover my sight
And Jesus said to him Go Your faith has made you well And immediately he recovered his sight and he began to follow him on the road


Now when they were getting near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples
and told them Go into the village that is within sight and as soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied on which no man has sat until now Untie it and bring it here
And if anyone says to you Why are you doing this say The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away
So they went away and found the colt tied at a door outside on the side street and they untied it
But some of those standing there said to them What are you doing untying the colt
They told them just what Jesus had said and they let them go
And they brought the colt to Jesus and they put their outer garments on it and he sat on it
Also many spread their outer garments on the road but others cut down foliage from the fields
And those going in front and those coming behind kept shouting Save we pray Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovahs name
Blessed is the coming Kingdom of our father David Save we pray in the heights above
And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple and he looked around at everything but since the hour was already late he went out to Bethany with the Twelve
The next day when they were leaving Bethany he felt hungry
From a distance he caught sight of a fig tree that had leaves and he went to see whether he could find something on it But on coming to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
So he said to it Let no one eat fruit from you ever again And his disciples were listening
They now came to Jerusalem There he entered the temple and started to throw out those selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
and he would not let anyone carry a utensil through the temple
He was teaching and saying to them Is it not written My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations But you have made it a cave of robbers
And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and they began to seek how to kill him for they were in fear of him because all the crowd was astounded at his teaching
When it became late in the day they went out of the city
But when they were passing by early in the morning they saw the fig tree already withered from its roots
Peter remembering it said to him Rabbi see the fig tree that you cursed has withered
In reply Jesus said to them Have faith in God
Truly I say to you that whoever tells this mountain Be lifted up and thrown into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says is going to happen he will have it happen
This is why I tell you all the things you pray and ask for have faith that you have received them and you will have them
And when you stand praying forgive whatever you have against anyone so that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses

They came again to Jerusalem And as he was walking in the temple the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came
and said to him By what authority do you do these things Or who gave you this authority to do these things
Jesus said to them I will ask you one question Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things
Was the baptism by John from heaven or from men Answer me
So they began to reason among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why then did you not believe him
But dare we say From men They were in fear of the crowd for these all held that John had really been a prophet
So they answered Jesus We do not know Jesus said to them Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things


Then he started to speak to them with illustrations A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected a tower then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad
In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them
But they took him beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
Again he sent another slave to them and that one they struck on the head and dishonored
And he sent another and that one they killed and many others some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed
One more he had a beloved son He sent him to them last saying They will respect my son
But those cultivators said among themselves This is the heir Come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours
So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
What will the owner of the vineyard do He will come and kill the cultivators and will give the vineyard to others
Did you never read this scripture The stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone
This has come from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes
At that they wanted to seize him but they feared the crowd for they knew that he spoke the illustration with them in mind So they left him and went away
Next they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the party followers of Herod in order to catch him in his speech
On arriving these said to him Teacher we know you are truthful and you do not seek anyones favor for you do not look at the outward appearance of people but you teach the way of God in line with truth Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not
Should we pay or should we not pay Detecting their hypocrisy he said to them Why do you put me to the test Bring me a denarius to look at
They brought one and he said to them Whose image and inscription is this They said to him Caesars
Jesus then said Pay back Caesars things to Caesar but Gods things to God And they were amazed at him
Now the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
Teacher Moses wrote us that if someones brother dies and leaves a wife behind but does not leave a child his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother
There were seven brothers The first took a wife but when he died he left no offspring
And the second married her but died without leaving offspring and the third the same way
And all seven left no offspring Last of all the woman also died
In the resurrection whose wife will she be For the seven had her as a wife
Jesus said to them Is not this why you are mistaken because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God
For when they rise from the dead neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage but they are as angels in the heavens
But concerning the dead being raised up have you not read in the book of Moses in the account about the thornbush that God said to him I am the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob
He is a God not of the dead but of the living You are very much mistaken
One of the scribes who had come up and heard them disputing knowing that he had answered them in a fine way asked him Which commandment is first of all
Jesus answered The first is Hear O Israel Jehovah our God is one Jehovah
and you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength
The second is this You must love your neighbor as yourself There is no other commandment greater than these
The scribe said to him Teacher you spoke well in line with truth He is One and there is no other besides him
and to love him with ones whole heart with ones whole understanding and with ones whole strength and to love ones neighbor as oneself is worth far more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
At this Jesus discerning that he had answered intelligently said to him You are not far from the Kingdom of God But no one had the courage to question him anymore
However as Jesus continued teaching in the temple he said How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is Davids son
By the holy spirit David himself said Jehovah said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet
David himself calls him Lord so how can it be that he is his son
And the large crowd was listening to him with pleasure
And in his teaching he went on to say Beware of the scribes who want to walk around in robes and want greetings in the marketplaces
and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals
They devour the houses of the widows and for show they make long prayers These will receive a more severe judgment
And he sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests and many rich people were dropping in many coins
Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value
So he called his disciples to him and said to them Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests
For they all put in out of their surplus but she out of her want put in everything she had all she had to live on


As he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said to him Teacher see what wonderful stones and buildings
However Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down
As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view Peter James John and Andrew asked him privately
Tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion
So Jesus began to tell them Look out that nobody misleads you
Many will come on the basis of my name saying I am he and will mislead many
Moreover when you hear of wars and reports of wars do not be alarmed these things must take place but the end is not yet
For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in one place after another there will also be food shortages These are a beginning of pangs of distress
As for you look out for yourselves People will hand you over to local courts and you will be beaten in synagogues and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them
Also in all the nations the good news has to be preached first
And when they are taking you to hand you over do not be anxious beforehand about what to say but whatever is given you in that hour say this for you are not the ones speaking but the holy spirit is
Furthermore brother will deliver brother over to death and a father a child and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death
And you will be hated by all people on account of my name But the one who has endured to the end will be saved
However when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation standing where it should not be let the reader use discernment then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains
Let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house
and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment
Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days
Keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime
for those days will be days of a tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time and will not occur again
In fact unless Jehovah had cut short the days no flesh would be saved But on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen he has cut short the days
Then too if anyone says to you See Here is the Christ or See There he is do not believe it
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray if possible the chosen ones
You then watch out I have told you all things beforehand
But in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
and the stars will be falling out of heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken
And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds from earths extremity to heavens extremity
Now learn this illustration from the fig tree Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves you know that summer is near
Likewise also you when you see these things happening know that he is near at the doors
Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows neither the angels in heaven nor the Son but the Father
Keep looking keep awake for you do not know when the appointed time is
It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves to each one his work and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch
Keep on the watch therefore for you do not know when the master of the house is coming whether late in the day or at midnight or at dawn or early in the morning
in order that when he comes suddenly he does not find you sleeping
But what I say to you I say to all Keep on the watch


Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread was two days later And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to seize him by cunning and kill him
for they were saying Not at the festival perhaps there might be an uproar of the people
And while he was at Bethany dining in the house of Simon the leper a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil genuine nard very expensive She broke open the alabaster jar and began pouring it on his head
At this some said to one another indignantly Why has this perfumed oil been wasted
For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and the money given to the poor And they were greatly annoyed with her
But Jesus said Let her alone Why do you try to make trouble for her She did a fine deed toward me
For you always have the poor with you and you can do them good whenever you want to but you will not always have me
She did what she could she poured perfumed oil on my body beforehand in view of the burial
Truly I say to you wherever the good news is preached in all the world what this woman did will also be told in memory of her
And Judas Iscariot one of the Twelve went off to the chief priests in order to betray him to them
When they heard it they were delighted and promised to give him silver money So he began seeking an opportunity to betray him
Now on the first day of the Unleavened Bread when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice his disciples said to him Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover
With that he sent two of his disciples and said to them Go into the city and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you Follow him
and wherever he goes inside say to the master of the house The Teacher says Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready Prepare it for us there
So the disciples went out and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them and they prepared for the Passover
After evening had fallen he came with the Twelve
And as they were reclining at the table and eating Jesus said Truly I say to you one of you who is eating with me will betray me
They began to be grieved and to say to him one by one It is not I is it
He said to them It is one of the Twelve the one dipping with me into the bowl
For the Son of man is going away just as it is written about him but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed It would have been better for that man if he had not been born
And as they continued eating he took a loaf said a blessing broke it and gave it to them saying Take it this means my body
And taking a cup he offered thanks and gave it to them and they all drank out of it
And he said to them This means my blood of the covenant which is to be poured out in behalf of many
Truly I say to you I will by no means drink anymore of the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the Kingdom of God
Finally after singing praises they went out to the Mount of Olives
And Jesus said to them You will all be stumbled for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered about
But after I have been raised up I will go ahead of you into Galilee
But Peter said to him Even if all the others are stumbled I will not be
At that Jesus said to him Truly I say to you that today yes on this very night before a rooster crows twice you will disown me three times
But he kept insisting If I have to die with you I will by no means disown you Also all the others began to say the same thing
So they came to a spot named Gethsemane and he said to his disciples Sit down here while I pray
And he took Peter and James and John along with him and he began to feel deeply distressed and to be greatly troubled
He said to them I am deeply grieved even to death Stay here and keep on the watch
And going a little way forward he fell to the ground and began praying that if it were possible the hour might pass away from him
And he said iAbbai Father all things are possible for you remove this cup from me Yet not what I want but what you want
He returned and found them sleeping and he said to Peter Simon are you sleeping Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour
Keep on the watch and pray continually so that you do not come into temptation The spirit of course is eager but the flesh is weak
And he went away again and prayed saying the same thing
And he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were weighed down so they did not know what to answer him
And he returned the third time and said to them At such a time as this you are sleeping and resting It is enough The hour has come Look The Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners
Get up let us go Look My betrayer has drawn near
And immediately while he was still speaking Judas one of the Twelve arrived and with him a crowd with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
Now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign saying Whoever it is I kiss he is the one take him into custody and lead him away under guard
And he came straight up and approached him and said Rabbi and gave him a tender kiss
So they seized him and took him into custody
However one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest taking off his ear
But in response Jesus said to them Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching and yet you did not take me into custody Nevertheless this is to fulfill the Scriptures
And they all abandoned him and fled
However a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby and they tried to seize him
but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked
They now led Jesus away to the high priest and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled
But Peter from a good distance followed him as far as into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting together with the house attendants and warming himself before a bright fire
Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death but they were not finding any
Many indeed were giving false witness against him but their testimonies were not in agreement
Also certain ones were standing up and bearing false witness against him saying
We heard him say I will throw down this temple that was made with hands and in three days I will build another not made with hands
But even on these grounds their testimony was not in agreement
Then the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned Jesus saying Do you say nothing in reply What is it these men are testifying against you
But he kept silent and made no reply at all Again the high priest began to question him and said to him Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One
Then Jesus said I am and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven
At this the high priest ripped his garments and said What further need do we have of witnesses
You heard the blasphemy What is your decision They all condemned him as deserving of death
And some started to spit on him and to cover his face and hit him with their fists and say to him Prophesy And slapping him in the face the court attendants took him
Now while Peter was below in the courtyard one of the servant girls of the high priest came
On seeing Peter warming himself she looked straight at him and said You too were with the Nazarene this Jesus
But he denied it saying Neither do I know him nor do I understand what you are talking about and he went outside to the entryway
There the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by This is one of them
Again he was denying it And after a little while those standing by again began saying to Peter Certainly you are one of them for you are in fact a Galilean
But he started to curse and swear I do not know this man of whom you speak
Immediately a rooster crowed a second time and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to him Before a rooster crows twice you will disown me three times And he broke down and began to weep


Immediately at dawn the chief priests with the elders and the scribes indeed the whole Sanhedrin consulted together and they bound Jesus and led him off and handed him over to Pilate
So Pilate put the question to him Are you the King of the Jews In answer he said You yourself say it
But the chief priests were accusing him of many things
Now Pilate began questioning him again saying Have you no reply to make See how many charges they are bringing against you
But Jesus made no further answer so that Pilate was amazed
Well from festival to festival he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested
At the time the man named Barabbas was in prison with the seditionists who in their sedition had committed murder
So the crowd came up and began to make their request according to what Pilate used to do for them
He responded to them saying Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews
For Pilate was aware that out of envy the chief priests had handed him over
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead
Again in reply Pilate said to them What then should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews
Once more they cried out To the stake with him
But Pilate went on to say to them Why What bad thing did he do Still they cried out all the more To the stake with him
At that Pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released Barabbas to them and after having Jesus whipped he handed him over to be executed on the stake
The soldiers now led him off into the courtyard that is into the governors residence and they called the whole body of troops together
And they dressed him in purple and braided a crown of thorns and put it on him
and they began to call out to him Greetings you King of the Jews
Also they were hitting him on the head with a reed and spitting on him and they got on their knees and bowed down to him
Finally after they had mocked him they stripped him of the purple and put his outer garments on him And they led him out to nail him to the stake
Also they compelled into service a passerby a certain Simon of Cyrene coming from the countryside the father of Alexander and Rufus to carry his torture stake
So they brought him to the place called iGolgothai which means when translated Skull Place
Here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh but he would not take it
And they nailed him to the stake and distributed his outer garments by casting lots over them to decide who would take what
It was now the third hour and they nailed him to the stake
And the inscription of the charge against him was written The King of the Jews
Moreover they put two robbers on stakes alongside him one on his right and one on his left

And those passing by spoke abusively to him shaking their heads and saying Ha You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days
save yourself by coming down off the torture stake
In the same way also the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves saying Others he saved himself he cannot save
Let the Christ the King of Israel now come down off the torture stake so that we may see and believe Even those who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him
When it became the sixth hour a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
And at the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice iEli Eli lama sabachthanii which means when translated My God my God why have you forsaken me
And some of those standing near on hearing it began to say See He is calling Elijah
Then someone ran soaked a sponge in sour wine put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying Let him be Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down
But Jesus let out a loud cry and expired
And the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom
Now when the army officer who was standing by with him in view saw that he had expired under these circumstances he said Certainly this man was Gods Son
There were also women watching from a distance among them Mary Magdalene as well as Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses and Salome
who used to accompany him and minister to him when he was in Galilee and many other women who had come up together with him to Jerusalem
Now as it was already late in the afternoon and since it was Preparation that is the day before the Sabbath
there came Joseph of Arimathea a reputable member of the Council who also himself was waiting for the Kingdom of God He took courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus
But Pilate wondered whether he could already be dead and summoning the army officer he asked him whether Jesus had already died
So after making certain from the army officer he granted the body to Joseph
After he bought fine linen and took him down he wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him in a tomb that was quarried out of rock then he rolled a stone up to the entrance of the tomb
But Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses continued looking at where he had been laid


So when the Sabbath was over Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body
And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they came to the tomb
They were saying to one another Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us
But when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away although it was very large
When they entered into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a white robe and they were stunned
He said to them Do not be stunned You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was executed on the stake He was raised up He is not here Look here is the place where they laid him
But go tell his disciples and Peter He is going ahead of you into Galilee You will see him there just as he told you
So when they came out they fled from the tomb trembling and overwhelmed with emotion And they said nothing to anyone for they were in fear


Seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us
just as these were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the message
I resolved also because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy to write them to you in logical order most excellent Theophilus
so that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally
In the days of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah of the division of Abijah His wife was from the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth
They both were righteous before God walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah
But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were well along in years
Now as he was serving as priest in the assignment of his division before God
according to the established practice of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah
And the entire multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense
Jehovahs angel appeared to him standing at the right side of the incense altar
But Zechariah became troubled at the sight and he was overcome with fear
However the angel said to him Do not be afraid Zechariah because your supplication has been favorably heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to name him John
You will have joy and great gladness and many will rejoice over his birth
for he will be great in the sight of Jehovah But he must drink no wine or any alcoholic drink at all and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth
and he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Jehovah their God
Also he will go ahead of him with Elijahs spirit and power to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones in order to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people
Zechariah said to the angel How can I be sure of this For I am old and my wife is well along in years
In reply the angel said to him I am Gabriel who stands near before God and I was sent to speak with you and to declare this good news to you
But look you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their appointed time
Meanwhile the people continued waiting for Zechariah and they were surprised that he delayed so long in the sanctuary
When he came out he was unable to speak to them and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary He kept making signs to them but remained speechless
When the days of his holy service were completed he went off to his home
Some days later Elizabeth his wife became pregnant and she kept herself secluded for five months saying
This is how Jehovah has dealt with me in these days He has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men
In her sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth
to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of Davids house and the name of the virgin was Mary
And coming in the angel said to her Greetings you highly favored one Jehovah is with you
But she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be
So the angel said to her Do not be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God
And look you will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you are to name him Jesus
This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father
and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever and there will be no end to his Kingdom
But Mary said to the angel How is this to be since I am not having sexual relations with a man
In answer the angel said to her Holy spirit will come upon you and power of the Most High will overshadow you And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy Gods Son
And look Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month for her the socalled barren woman
for no declaration will be impossible for God
Then Mary said Look Jehovahs slave girl May it happen to me according to your declaration At that the angel departed from her
So Mary set out in those days and traveled with haste into the mountainous country to a city of Judah
and she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth
Well as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary the infant in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit
and loudly cried out Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruitage of your womb
So how is it that this privilege is mine to have the mother of my Lord come to me
For look as the sound of your greeting reached my ears the infant in my womb leaped for joy
Happy too is she who believed for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from Jehovah
And Mary said My soul magnifies Jehovah
and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at God my Savior
because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl For look from now on all generations will declare me happy
because the powerful One has done great deeds for me and holy is his name
and for generation after generation his mercy is upon those who fear him
He has acted mightily with his arm he has scattered those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts
He has brought down powerful men from thrones and has exalted lowly ones
he has fully satisfied hungry ones with good things and has sent away emptyhanded those who had wealth
He has come to the aid of Israel his servant remembering his mercy
just as he spoke to our forefathers to Abraham and to his offspring forever
Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home
The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth and she gave birth to a son
And the neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah had magnified his mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
On the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah
But his mother said in reply No but he will be called John
At this they said to her Not one of your relatives is called by this name
Then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called
So he asked for a tablet and wrote John is his name At this they were all amazed
Instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue was set free and he began to speak praising God
And fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood and all these things began to be talked about in the whole mountainous country of Judea
And all who heard noted it in their hearts saying What will this young child turn out to be For the hand of Jehovah was indeed with him
Then Zechariah his father was filled with holy spirit and he prophesied saying
Let Jehovah be praised the God of Israel because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance
And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant
just as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old
of a salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us
to show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant
the oath that he swore to Abraham our forefather
to grant us after we have been rescued from the hands of enemies the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him
with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days
But as for you young child you will be called a prophet of the Most High for you will go ahead of Jehovah to prepare his ways
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins
because of the tender compassion of our God With this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high
to give light to those sitting in darkness and deaths shadow and to guide our feet in the way of peace
And the young child grew up and became strong in spirit and he continued in the desert until the day he showed himself openly to Israel


Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be registered
This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria
And all the people went to be registered each one to his own city
Of course Joseph also went up from Galilee from the city of Nazareth into Judea to Davids city which is called Bethlehem because of his being a member of the house and family of David
He went to get registered with Mary who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth
While they were there the time came for her to give birth
And she gave birth to her son the firstborn and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the lodging place
There were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks
Suddenly Jehovahs angel stood before them and Jehovahs glory gleamed around them and they became very fearful
But the angel said to them Do not be afraid for look I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have
For today there was born to you in Davids city a savior who is Christ the Lord
And this is a sign for you You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger
Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying
Glory in the heights above to God and on earth peace among men of goodwill
So when the angels had departed from them into heaven the shepherds began saying to one another Let us by all means go over to Bethlehem and see what has taken place which Jehovah has made known to us
And they went quickly and found Mary as well as Joseph and the infant lying in the manger
When they saw this they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child
And all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them
but Mary began to preserve all these sayings drawing conclusions in her heart
Then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen just as it had been told to them
After eight days when it was time to circumcise him he was named Jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived
Also when the time came for purifying them according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah
just as it is written in Jehovahs Law Every firstborn male must be called holy to Jehovah
And they offered a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of Jehovah a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
And look there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon and this man was righteous and devout waiting for Israels consolation and holy spirit was upon him
Furthermore it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah
Under the power of the spirit he now came into the temple and as the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the Law
he took the child into his arms and praised God and said
Now Sovereign Lord you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration
because my eyes have seen your means of salvation
that you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples
a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel
And the childs father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him
Also Simeon blessed them and said to Mary the childs mother Look This child is appointed for the falling and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign to be spoken against
yes a long sword will be run through you in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed
Now there was a prophetess Anna the daughter of Phanuel of Ashers tribe This woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married
and she was a widow now 84 years old She was never missing from the temple rendering sacred service night and day with fasting and supplications
In that very hour she came near and began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for Jerusalems deliverance
So when they had carried out all the things according to the Law of Jehovah they went back into Galilee to their own city Nazareth
And the young child continued growing and getting strong being filled with wisdom and Gods favor continued upon him
Now his parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover
And when he was 12 years old they went up according to the custom of the festival
When the days of the festival were over and they were returning the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not notice it
Assuming that he was in the group traveling together they went a days journey and then began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances
But not finding him they returned to Jerusalem and made a diligent search for him
Well after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions
But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers
Now when his parents saw him they were astounded and his mother said to him Child why did you treat us this way Here your father and I have been frantically looking for you
But he said to them Why were you looking for me Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father
However they did not understand what he was saying to them
Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth and he continued subject to them Also his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart
And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men


In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea Herod was district ruler of Galilee Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis and Lysanias was district ruler of Abilene
in the days of chief priest Annas and of Caiaphas Gods declaration came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness
So he went into all the country around the Jordan preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins
just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet A voice of one crying out in the wilderness Prepare the way of Jehovah Make his roads straight
Every valley must be filled up and every mountain and hill leveled the crooked ways must become straight and the rough ways smooth
and all flesh will see the salvation of God
So he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him You offspring of vipers who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath
Therefore produce fruits that befit repentance Do not start saying to yourselves We have Abraham as our father For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones
Indeed the ax is already lying at the root of the trees Every tree then that does not produce fine fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire
And the crowds were asking him What then should we do
In reply he said to them Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none and let the one who has something to eat do the same
Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him Teacher what should we do
He said to them Do not demand anything more than the tax rate
Also those in military service were asking him What should we do And he said to them Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely but be satisfied with your provisions
Now the people were in expectation and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John May he perhaps be the Christ
John gave the answer saying to all I for my part baptize you with water but the one stronger than I am is coming the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire
His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out
He also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people
But Herod the district ruler because of being reproved by John concerning Herodias the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod had done
added this also to all those deeds He locked John up in prison
Now when all the people were baptized Jesus too was baptized As he was praying the heaven was opened up
and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him and a voice came out of heaven You are my Son the beloved I have approved you

Then Jesus full of holy spirit turned away from the Jordan and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness
for 40 days being tempted by the Devil And he ate nothing in those days so when they had ended he felt hungry
At this the Devil said to him If you are a son of God tell this stone to become a loaf of bread
But Jesus answered him It is written Man must not live on bread alone
So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time
Then the Devil said to him I will give you all this authority and their glory because it has been handed over to me and I give it to whomever I wish
If you therefore do an act of worship before me it will all be yours
In reply Jesus said to him It is written It is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service
He then led him into Jerusalem and stationed him on the battlement of the temple and said to him If you are a son of God throw yourself down from here
for it is written He will give his angels a command concerning you to preserve you
and They will carry you on their hands so that you may not strike your foot against a stone
In answer Jesus said to him It is said You must not put Jehovah your God to the test
So the Devil having finished all the temptation departed from him until another convenient time
Now Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee And good reports about him spread throughout all the surrounding country
Also he began to teach in their synagogues and he was held in honor by all
He then went to Nazareth where he had been brought up and according to his custom on the Sabbath day he entered the synagogue and stood up to read
So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written
Jehovahs spirit is upon me because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind to send the crushed ones away free
to preach Jehovahs acceptable year
With that he rolled up the scroll handed it back to the attendant and sat down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him
Then he began to say to them Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled
And they all began to give favorable witness about him and to be amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth and they were saying This is a son of Joseph is it not
At this he said to them No doubt you will apply this saying to me Physician cure yourself Do also here in your home territory the things we have heard were done in Capernaum
So he said Truly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory
For instance I tell you in truth There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when heaven was shut up for three years and six months and a great famine came on all the land
Yet Elijah was sent to none of those women but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon
Also there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansed only Naaman the Syrian
Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger
and they rose up and rushed him outside the city and they led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city had been built in order to throw him down headlong
But he went right through their midst and continued on his way
He then went down to Capernaum a city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the Sabbath
and they were astounded at his way of teaching because he spoke with authority
Now in the synagogue there was a man with a spirit an unclean demon and he shouted with a loud voice
Ah What have we to do with you Jesus the Nazarene Did you come to destroy us I know exactly who you are the Holy One of God
But Jesus rebuked it saying Be silent and come out of him So after throwing the man down in their midst the demon came out of him without hurting him
At this they were all astonished and began to say to one another What kind of speech is this For with authority and power he orders the unclean spirits and out they come
So the news about him kept spreading into every corner of the surrounding country
After leaving the synagogue he entered into Simons home Now Simons motherinlaw was suffering with a high fever and they asked him to help her
So he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her Instantly she got up and began ministering to them
But when the sun was setting all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him By laying his hands on each one of them he cured them
Demons also came out of many crying out and saying You are the Son of God But rebuking them he would not permit them to speak for they knew him to be the Christ
However at daybreak he departed and went to an isolated place But the crowds began searching for him and came to where he was and they tried to keep him from going away from them
But he said to them I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities because for this I was sent
So he went on preaching in the synagogues of Judea


On one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of God he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret
And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets
Going aboard one of the boats which was Simons he asked him to pull away a bit from land Then he sat down and he began teaching the crowds from the boat
When he stopped speaking he said to Simon Pull out to where it is deep and let down your nets for a catch
But in reply Simon said Instructor we toiled all night and caught nothing but at your word I will lower the nets
Well when they did this they caught a great number of fish In fact their nets began ripping apart
So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them and they came and filled both boats so that these began to sink
Seeing this Simon Peter fell down at the knees of Jesus saying Depart from me Lord because I am a sinful man
For both he and those with him were overwhelmed with astonishment at the catch of fish they had taken
and the same was true of both James and John Zebedees sons who were partners with Simon But Jesus said to Simon Stop being afraid From now on you will be catching men alive
So they brought the boats back to land and abandoned everything and followed him
On another occasion while he was in one of the cities look there was a man full of leprosy When he caught sight of Jesus he fell facedown and begged him Lord if you just want to you can make me clean
So stretching out his hand he touched him saying I want to Be made clean Immediately the leprosy vanished from him
Then he gave the man orders to tell no one But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing just as Moses directed for a witness to them
But the news about him just kept spreading and large crowds would gather together to listen and to be cured of their sicknesses
However he often went into the desolate areas to pray
On one of those days while he was teaching Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem were sitting there and Jehovahs power was with him to do healing
And look men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher and they were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus
So not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd they climbed up to the roof and they lowered him on the stretcher through the tiling right among those in front of Jesus
When he saw their faith he said Man your sins are forgiven
Then the scribes and the Pharisees started to reason saying Who is this who speaks blasphemies Who can forgive sins except God alone
But Jesus discerning their reasoning said in answer to them What are you reasoning in your hearts
Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk
But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralyzed man I say to you Get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
At that he stood up before them picked up what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying God
Then one and all were seized with amazement and they began to glorify God and they became filled with awe saying We have seen wonderful things today
Now after this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office and he said to him Be my follower
And leaving everything behind he rose up and began to follow him
Then Levi spread a big reception feast for him in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were dining with them
At this the Pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples saying Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
In reply Jesus said to them Those who are healthy do not need a physician but those who are ill do
I have come to call not righteous people but sinners to repentance
They said to him Johns disciples fast frequently and offer supplications and so do those of the Pharisees but yours eat and drink
Jesus said to them You cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them can you
But days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from them then they will fast in those days
He also gave an illustration to them Nobody cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it on an old garment If he does then the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old
Also no one puts new wine into old wineskins If he does the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined
But new wine must be put into new wineskins
No one after drinking old wine wants new for he says The old is nice


Now on a sabbath he was passing through grainfields and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain rubbing them with their hands
At this some of the Pharisees said Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath
But in reply Jesus said to them Have you never read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry
How he entered into the house of God and received the loaves of presentation and ate and gave some to the men with him which it is not lawful for anyone to eat but for the priests only
Then he said to them The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath
On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and began teaching And a man was there whose right hand was withered
The scribes and the Pharisees were now watching Jesus closely to see whether he would cure on the Sabbath in order to find some way to accuse him
He however knew their reasoning so he said to the man with the withered hand Get up and stand in the center And he rose and stood there
Then Jesus said to them I ask you men Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to destroy it
After looking around at them all he said to the man Stretch out your hand He did so and his hand was restored
But they flew into a senseless rage and they began to talk over with one another what they might do to Jesus
On one of those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the whole night in prayer to God
And when it became day he called his disciples to him and chose from among them 12 whom he also named apostles
 verses divided into subverses in order to have names in new lines
Simon whom he also named Peter Andrew his brother
James John
Philip Bartholomew
Matthew Thomas
James the son of Alphaeus
Simon who is called the zealous one
Judas the son of James
and Judas Iscariot who turned traitor

And he came down with them and stood on a level place and there was a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon who came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses
Even those troubled with unclean spirits were cured
And all the crowd were seeking to touch him because power was going out of him and healing them all
And he looked up at his disciples and began to say
Happy are you who are poor for yours is the Kingdom of God
Happy are you who hunger now for you will be filled
Happy are you who weep now for you will laugh
Happy are you whenever men hate you and when they exclude you and reproach you and denounce your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy for look your reward is great in heaven for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets
But woe to you who are rich for you are having your consolation in full
Woe to you who are filled up now for you will go hungry
Woe you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep
Woe whenever all men speak well of you for this is what their forefathers did to the false prophets
But I say to you who are listening Continue to love your enemies to do good to those hating you
to bless those cursing you to pray for those who are insulting you
To him who strikes you on the one cheek offer the other also and from him who takes away your outer garment do not withhold the inner garment either
Give to everyone asking you and from the one taking your things away do not ask them back
Also just as you want men to do to you do the same way to them
If you love those loving you of what credit is it to you For even the sinners love those loving them
And if you do good to those doing good to you of what credit is it to you Even the sinners do the same
Also if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment of what credit is it to you Even sinners lend to sinners so that they may get back as much
On the contrary continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without hoping for anything back and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked
Continue being merciful just as your Father is merciful
Moreover stop judging and you will by no means be judged and stop condemning and you will by no means be condemned Keep on forgiving and you will be forgiven
Practice giving and people will give to you They will pour into your laps a fine measure pressed down shaken together and overflowing For with the measure that you are measuring out they will measure out to you in return
Then he also told them an illustration A blind man cannot guide a blind man can he Both will fall into a pit will they not
A student is not above his teacher but everyone who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher
Why then do you look at the straw in your brothers eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye
How can you say to your brother Brother allow me to remove the straw that is in your eye while you yourself do not see the rafter in your own eye Hypocrite First remove the rafter from your own eye and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw that is in your brothers eye
For no fine tree produces rotten fruit and no rotten tree produces fine fruit
For each tree is known by its own fruit For example people do not gather figs from thorns nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush
A good man brings good out of the good treasure of his heart but a wicked man brings what is wicked out of his wicked treasure for out of the hearts abundance his mouth speaks
Why then do you call me Lord Lord but do not do the things I say
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them I will show you whom he is like
He is like a man who in building a house dug and went down deep and laid a foundation on the rock Consequently when a flood came the river dashed against that house but was not strong enough to shake it for it was wellbuilt
On the other hand whoever hears and does nothing is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation The river dashed against it and immediately it collapsed and the ruin of that house was great


When he had completed what he had to say to the people he entered Capernaum
Now an army officers slave who was dear to him was seriously ill and about to pass away
When he heard about Jesus he sent some elders of the Jews to him to ask him to come and make his slave well
They came up to Jesus and began to plead with him earnestly saying He is worthy of your granting him this
for he loves our nation and he himself built our synagogue
So Jesus went with them But when he was not far from the house the army officer had already sent friends to say to him Sir do not bother for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof
That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you But say the word and let my servant be healed
For I too am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my slave Do this and he does it
When Jesus heard these things he was amazed at him and he turned to the crowd following him and said I tell you not even in Israel have I found so great a faith
And when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health
Soon afterward he traveled to a city called Nain and his disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him
As he got near the gate of the city why look there was a dead man being carried out the only son of his mother Besides she was a widow A considerable crowd from the city was also with her
When the Lord caught sight of her he was moved with pity for her and he said to her Stop weeping
With that he approached and touched the bier and the bearers stood still Then he said Young man I say to you get up
And the dead man sat up and started to speak and Jesus gave him to his mother
Now fear seized them all and they began to glorify God saying A great prophet has been raised up among us and God has turned his attention to his people
And this news concerning him spread out into all Judea and all the surrounding country
Now Johns disciples reported to him all these things
So John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask Are you the Coming One or are we to expect a different one
When they came to him the men said John the Baptist sent us to you to ask Are you the Coming One or are we to expect another
In that hour he cured many people of sicknesses serious diseases and wicked spirits and he granted many blind people the gift of sight
In reply he said to them Go and report to John what you have seen and heard The blind are now seeing the lame are walking the lepers are being cleansed the deaf are hearing the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news
Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me
When the messengers of John had gone away Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John What did you go out into the wilderness to see A reed being tossed by the wind
What then did you go out to see A man dressed in soft garments Why those wearing splendid dress and living in luxury are in royal houses
Really then what did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and far more than a prophet
This is the one about whom it is written Look I am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way ahead of you
I tell you among those born of women there is no one greater than John but a lesser person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is
When all the people and the tax collectors heard this they declared God to be righteous for they had been baptized with the baptism of John
But the Pharisees and those versed in the Law disregarded the counsel of God to them since they had not been baptized by him
With whom therefore should I compare the men of this generation and whom are they like
They are like young children sitting in a marketplace and calling out to one another saying We played the flute for you but you did not dance we wailed but you did not weep
Likewise John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine but you say He has a demon
The Son of man has come eating and drinking but you say Look A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine a friend of tax collectors and sinners
All the same wisdom is proved righteous by all its children
Now one of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him So he entered the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table
And look a woman who was known in the city to be a sinner learned that he was dining in the house of the Pharisee and she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil
Taking a position behind him at his feet she wept and began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them off with the hair of her head Also she tenderly kissed his feet and poured the perfumed oil on them
Seeing this the Pharisee who had invited him said to himself If this man were really a prophet he would know who and what kind of woman it is who is touching him that she is a sinner
But in reply Jesus said to him Simon I have something to say to you He said Teacher say it
Two men were debtors to a certain lender the one was in debt for 500 denarii but the other for 50
When they did not have anything to pay him back with he freely forgave them both Therefore which one of them will love him more
In answer Simon said I suppose it is the one whom he forgave more He said to him You judged correctly
With that he turned to the woman and said to Simon Do you see this woman I entered your house you gave me no water for my feet But this woman wet my feet with her tears and wiped them off with her hair
You gave me no kiss but this woman from the hour that I came in did not stop tenderly kissing my feet
You did not pour oil on my head but this woman poured perfumed oil on my feet
Because of this I tell you her sins many though they are are forgiven because she loved much But the one who is forgiven little loves little
Then he said to her Your sins are forgiven
Those reclining at the table with him started to say among themselves Who is this man who even forgives sins
But he said to the woman Your faith has saved you go in peace


Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God And the Twelve were with him
as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses Mary who was called Magdalene from whom seven demons had come out
Joanna the wife of Chuza Herods man in charge Susanna and many other women who were ministering to them from their belongings
Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city he spoke by means of an illustration
A sower went out to sow his seed As he was sowing some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on and the birds of heaven ate them up
Some landed on the rock and after sprouting they dried up because they had no moisture
Others fell among the thorns and the thorns that grew up with them choked them
But others fell on the good soil and after sprouting they produced 100 times more fruit As he said these things he called out Let the one who has ears to listen listen
But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant
He said To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God but for the rest it is in illustrations so that though looking they may look in vain and though hearing they may not get the sense
Now the illustration means this The seed is the word of God
Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved
Those on the rock are the ones who when they hear the word receive it with joy but these have no root They believe for a while but in a season of testing they fall away
As for that which fell among the thorns these are the ones who have heard but by being carried away by anxieties riches and pleasures of this life they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity
As for that on the fine soil these are the ones who after hearing the word with a fine and good heart retain it and bear fruit with endurance
No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light
For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open
Therefore pay attention to how you listen for whoever has will be given more but whoever does not have even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him
Now his mother and brothers came to him but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd
So it was reported to him Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you
In reply he said to them My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it
One day he and his disciples got into a boat and he said to them Let us cross to the other side of the lake So they set sail
But as they were sailing along he fell asleep And a violent windstorm descended on the lake and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger
So they went and woke him up saying Instructor Instructor we are about to perish With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they subsided and a calm set in
Then he said to them Where is your faith But they were filled with fear and were astounded saying to one another Who really is this For he orders even the winds and the water and they obey him
And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerasenes which is on the side opposite Galilee
As Jesus got out onto land a demonpossessed man from the city met him For a considerable time he had not worn clothing and he was staying not in a house but among the tombs
At the sight of Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice he said What have I to do with you Jesus Son of the Most High God I beg you do not torment me
For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man It had seized him on many occasions and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places
Jesus asked him What is your name He said Legion for many demons had entered into him
And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss
Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine and he gave them permission
With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned
But when the herders saw what had happened they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside
Then people went out to see what had happened They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out clothed and in his right mind sitting at the feet of Jesus and they grew fearful
Those who had seen it reported to them how the demonpossessed man had been made well
Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to go away from them because they were gripped by great fear Then he went aboard the boat to depart
However the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him but he sent the man away saying
Go back home and keep on relating what God did for you So he went away proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him
When Jesus returned the crowd received him kindly for they were all expecting him
But look a man named Jairus came this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house
because his only daughter who was about 12 years old was dying
As Jesus was going the crowds pressed in on him
Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone
She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment and immediately her flow of blood stopped
So Jesus said Who touched me When they were all denying it Peter said Instructor the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you
But Jesus said Someone touched me for I know that power went out of me
Seeing that she had not escaped notice the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately
But he said to her Daughter your faith has made you well Go in peace
While he was yet speaking a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came saying Your daughter has died do not bother the Teacher any longer
On hearing this Jesus answered him Have no fear only have faith and she will be saved
When he reached the house he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter John James and the girls father and mother
But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her So he said Stop weeping for she did not die but is sleeping
At this they began to laugh at him scornfully because they knew she had died
But he took her by the hand and called to her Child get up
And her spirit returned and she rose immediately and he ordered that something be given her to eat
Well her parents were beside themselves but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened


Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases
And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal
and he said to them Carry nothing for the trip neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money neither have two garments
But wherever you enter into a home stay there and leave from there
And wherever people do not receive you on going out of that city shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them
Then starting out they went through the territory from village to village declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere
Now Herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead
but others were saying that Elijah had appeared and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen
Herod said John I beheaded Who then is this about whom I am hearing such things So he was trying to see him
When the apostles returned they reported to Jesus all they had done With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida
But the crowds getting to know it followed him And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God and he healed those needing a cure
Then the day was coming to a close The Twelve now came up and said to him Send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions because out here we are in an isolated place
But he said to them You give them something to eat They said We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people
There were in fact about 5000 men But he said to his disciples Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each
And they did so and had them all sit down
Taking now the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed them Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd
So they all ate and were satisfied and they took up the leftovers 12 baskets of fragments
Later while he was praying alone the disciples came to him and he questioned them saying Who are the crowds saying that I am
In reply they said John the Baptist but others say Elijah and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen
Then he said to them You though who do you say I am Peter answered The Christ of God
Then in a stern talk to them he instructed them not to tell this to anybody
but he said The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised up
Then he went on to say to all If anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it
Really what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin
For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels
But I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God
In fact about eight days after saying these words he took Peter John and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray
And as he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white
And look two men were conversing with him they were Moses and Elijah
These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem
Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him
And as these were departing from him Peter said to Jesus Instructor it is fine for us to be here So let us erect three tents one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah He did not realize what he was saying
But as he was saying these things a cloud formed and began to overshadow them As they entered into the cloud they became afraid
Then a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my Son the one who has been chosen Listen to him
As the voice spoke Jesus was found alone But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw
The following day when they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him
And look a man called out from the crowd saying Teacher I beg you to take a look at my son because he is my only one
And look a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him
I begged your disciples to expel it but they could not
In response Jesus said O faithless and twisted generation how long must I continue with you and put up with you Bring your son over here
But even as he was approaching the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion However Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father
And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God
While they were all astonished at all the things he was doing he said to his disciples
Listen carefully and remember these words for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands
But they did not understand what he was saying In fact it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it and they were afraid to question him about this saying
Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest
Jesus knowing the reasoning of their hearts took a young child stood him beside him
and said to them Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great
In response John said Instructor we saw someone expelling demons by using your name and we tried to prevent him because he is not following with us
But Jesus said to him Do not try to prevent him for whoever is not against you is for you
As the days were drawing near for him to be taken up he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem
So he sent messengers ahead of him And they went and entered a village of Samaritans to make preparations for him
But they did not receive him because he was determined to go to Jerusalem
When the disciples James and John saw this they said Lord do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them
But he turned and rebuked them
So they went to a different village
Now as they were going along the road someone said to him I will follow you wherever you go
But Jesus said to him Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head
Then he said to another Be my follower The man said Lord permit me first to go and bury my father
But he said to him Let the dead bury their dead but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God
And still another said I will follow you Lord but first permit me to say goodbye to those in my household
Jesus said to him No man who has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is wellsuited for the Kingdom of God


After these things the Lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go
Then he said to them Yes the harvest is great but the workers are few Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest
Go Look I am sending you out as lambs in among wolves
Do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals and do not greet anyone along the road
Wherever you enter into a house say first May this house have peace
And if a friend of peace is there your peace will rest upon him But if there is not it will return to you
So stay in that house eating and drinking the things they provide for the worker is worthy of his wages Do not keep transferring from house to house
Also wherever you enter into a city and they receive you eat what is set before you
and cure the sick ones in it and tell them The Kingdom of God has come near to you
But wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you go out into its main streets and say
We wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city Nevertheless know this that the Kingdom of God has come near
I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom in that day than for that city
Woe to you Chorazin Woe to you Bethsaida because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon they would long ago have repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes
Consequently it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you
And you Capernaum will you perhaps be exalted to heaven Down to the Grave you will come
Whoever listens to you listens to me And whoever disregards you disregards me also Moreover whoever disregards me disregards also him who sent me
Then the 70 returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name
At that he said to them I see Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven
Look I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing at all will harm you
Nevertheless do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens
In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said I publicly praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children Yes O Father because this is the way you approved
All things have been handed over to me by my Father and no one knows who the Son is except the Father and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him
With that he turned to the disciples and told them privately Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing
For I say to you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them
Now look a man versed in the Law stood up to test him and said Teacher what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life
He said to him What is written in the Law How do you read
In answer he said You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind and your neighbor as yourself
He said to him You answered correctly keep doing this and you will get life
But wanting to prove himself righteous the man said to Jesus Who really is my neighbor
In reply Jesus said A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell victim to robbers who stripped him beat him and went off leaving him halfdead
Now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road but when he saw him he passed by on the opposite side
Likewise a Levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the opposite side
But a certain Samaritan traveling the road came upon him and at seeing him he was moved with pity
So he approached him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him
The next day he took out two denarii gave them to the innkeeper and said Take care of him and whatever you spend besides this I will repay you when I return
Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers
He said The one who acted mercifully toward him Jesus then said to him Go and do the same yourself
Now as they went on their way he entered into a certain village Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house
She also had a sister called Mary who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying
Martha on the other hand was distracted with attending to many duties So she came to him and said Lord does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things Tell her to come and help me
In answer the Lord said to her Martha Martha you are anxious and disturbed about many things
A few things though are needed or just one For her part Mary chose the good portion and it will not be taken away from her


Now he was in a certain place praying and when he stopped one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us how to pray just as John also taught his disciples
So he said to them Whenever you pray say
Father let your name be sanctified
Let your Kingdom come
Give us each day our bread according to our daily needs
And forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us
and do not bring us into temptation
Then he said to them Suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him Friend lend me three loaves
because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to offer him
But that one replies from inside Stop bothering me The door is already locked and my young children are with me in bed I cannot get up and give you anything
I tell you even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs
So I say to you keep on asking and it will be given you keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and it will be opened to you
For everyone asking receives and everyone seeking finds and to everyone knocking it will be opened
Indeed which father among you if his son asks for a fish will hand him a serpent instead of a fish
Or if he also asks for an egg will hand him a scorpion
Therefore if you although being wicked know how to give good gifts to your children how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him
Later he expelled a speechless demon After the demon came out the speechless man spoke and the crowds were amazed
But some of them said He expels the demons by means of Beelzebub the ruler of the demons
And others to test him began demanding a sign out of heaven from him
Knowing their thinking he said to them Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin and a house divided against itself falls
In the same way if Satan is also divided against himself how will his kingdom stand For you say I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub
If I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub by whom do your sons expel them This is why they will be your judges
But if it is by means of Gods finger that I expel the demons the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you
When a strong wellarmed man guards his palace his belongings remain secure
But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting and he divides up the things he took from him
Whoever is not on my side is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through waterless places in search of a restingplace and after finding none it says I will return to my house from which I moved
And on arriving it finds the house swept clean and adorned
Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself and after getting inside they dwell there So the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first
Now as he was saying these things a woman from the crowd called out to him Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you
But he said No rather happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it
When the crowds were massing together he began to say This generation is a wicked generation it looks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah
For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so will the Son of man be to this generation
The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon But look something more than Solomon is here
The men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at what Jonah preached But look something more than Jonah is here
After lighting a lamp a person puts it not in a hidden place nor under a basket but on the lampstand so that those who come in may see the light
The lamp of the body is your eye When your eye is focused your whole body is also bright but when it is envious your body is also dark
Be alert therefore that the light that is in you is not darkness
Therefore if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays
When he had said this a Pharisee asked him to dine with him So he went in and reclined at the table
However the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner
But the Lord said to him Now you Pharisees you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness
Unreasonable ones The one who made the outside made also the inside did he not
But give as gifts of mercy the things that are from within and look everything about you will be clean
But woe to you Pharisees because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb but you disregard the justice and the love of God These things you were under obligation to do but not to disregard those other things
Woe to you Pharisees because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces
Woe to you because you are as those graves that are not clearly visible that men walk on and do not know it
In reply one of those versed in the Law said to him Teacher in saying these things you insult us also
Then he said Woe also to you who are versed in the Law because you load men down with loads hard to carry but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers
Woe to you because you build the tombs of the prophets but your forefathers killed them
Certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers and yet you approve of them for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs
That is why the wisdom of God also said I will send prophets and apostles to them and they will kill and persecute some of them
so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against this generation
from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah who was killed between the altar and the house Yes I tell you it will be charged against this generation
Woe to you who are versed in the Law because you took away the key of knowledge You yourselves did not go in and you hinder those going in
So when he went out from there the scribes and the Pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions
lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say


In the meantime when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another he started by saying first to his disciples Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy
But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed and nothing secret that will not become known
Therefore whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops
Moreover I say to you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more
But I will show you whom to fear Fear the One who after killing has authority to throw into Gehenna Yes I tell you fear this One
Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value do they not Yet not one of them is forgotten by God
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered Have no fear you are worth more than many sparrows
I say to you everyone who acknowledges me before men the Son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God
But whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God
And everyone who says a word against the Son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven
When they bring you in before public assemblies government officials and authorities do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say
for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say
Then someone in the crowd said to him Teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me
He said to him Man who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two
Then he said to them Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses
With that he told them an illustration saying The land of a rich man produced well
So he began reasoning within himself What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops
Then he said I will do this I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones and there I will gather all my grain and all my goods
and I will say to myself You have many good things stored up for many years take it easy eat drink enjoy yourself
But God said to him Unreasonable one this night they are demanding your life from you Who then is to have the things you stored up
So it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God
Then he said to his disciples That is why I say to you stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear
For the life is worth more than food and the body more than clothing
Consider the ravens They neither sow seed nor reap they have neither barn nor storehouse yet God feeds them Are you not worth much more than birds
Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span
If therefore you cannot do such a small thing why be anxious about the remaining things
Consider how the lilies grow They neither toil nor spin but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these
Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven how much more will he clothe you you with little faith
So stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink and stop being in anxious suspense
for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing but your Father knows you need these things
Instead keep seeking his Kingdom and these things will be added to you
Have no fear little flock for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom
Sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy Make money pouches that do not wear out a neverfailing treasure in the heavens where no thief gets near and no moth consumes
For where your treasure is there your hearts will be also
Be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning
and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage so when he comes and knocks they may at once open to him
Happy are those slaves whom the master on coming finds watching Truly I say to you he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them
And if he comes in the second watch even if in the third and finds them ready happy are they
But know this if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come he would not have let his house be broken into
You also keep ready because at an hour that you do not think likely the Son of man is coming
Then Peter said Lord are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone
And the Lord said Who really is the faithful steward the discreet one whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time
Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so
I tell you truthfully he will appoint him over all his belongings
But if ever that slave should say in his heart My master delays coming and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk
the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones
Then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked will be beaten with many strokes
But the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few Indeed everyone to whom much was given much will be demanded of him and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him
I came to start a fire on the earth and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit
Indeed I have a baptism with which to be baptized and how I am distressed until it is finished
Do you think I came to give peace on the earth No I tell you but rather division
For from now on there will be five in one house divided three against two and two against three
They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw
Then he also said to the crowds When you see a cloud rising in the west at once you say A storm is coming and it happens
And when you see that a south wind is blowing you say There will be a heat wave and it occurs
Hypocrites you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to examine this particular time
Why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous
For example when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler while on the way get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge and the judge deliver you to the court officer and the court officer throw you into prison
I tell you you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin


At that time some who were present reported to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices
In reply he said to them Do you think that those Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans because they have suffered these things
No I tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise be destroyed
Or those 18 on whom the tower in Siloam fell killing themdo you think that they had greater guilt than all other men who live in Jerusalem
No I tell you but unless you repent you will all be destroyed as they were
Then he went on to tell this illustration A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it but found none
Then he said to the vinedresser Here it is three years that I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree but have found none Cut it down Why should it keep the ground useless
In reply he said to him Master leave it alone for one more year until I dig around it and put on manure
If it produces fruit in the future well and good but if not then cut it down
Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath
And look a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness for 18 years and she was bent double and was unable to straighten up at all
When he saw her Jesus addressed her and said Woman you are released from your weakness
And he laid his hands on her and instantly she straightened up and began to glorify God
But in response the presiding officer of the synagogue indignant because Jesus did the cure on the Sabbath said to the crowd There are six days on which work ought to be done so come and be cured on those days and not on the Sabbath day
However the Lord answered him Hypocrites does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his bull or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it something to drink
Should not this woman who is a daughter of Abraham and whom Satan held bound for 18 years be released from this bondage on the Sabbath day
Well when he said these things all his opposers began to feel shame but the entire crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things he did
So he went on to say What is the Kingdom of God like and with what can I compare it
It is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of heaven nested in its branches
And again he said With what can I compare the Kingdom of God
It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented
And he traveled from city to city and from village to village teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem
Now a man said to him Lord are those being saved few He said to them
Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door because many I tell you will seek to get in but will not be able
When the householder gets up and locks the door you will stand outside knocking at the door saying Lord open to us But in answer he will say to you I do not know where you are from
Then you will start saying We ate and drank in your presence and you taught in our main streets
But he will say to you I do not know where you are from Get away from me all you workers of unrighteousness
There is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be when you see Abraham Isaac Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown outside
Furthermore people will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline at the table in the Kingdom of God
And look there are those last who will be first and there are those first who will be last
In that very hour some of the Pharisees came up and told him Get out and go away from here because Herod wants to kill you
And he said to them Go and tell that fox Look I am casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow and on the third day I will be finished
Nevertheless I must go on today tomorrow and the following day because it cannot be that a prophet should be put to death outside of Jerusalem
Jerusalem Jerusalem the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to herhow often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings But you did not want it
Look Your house is abandoned to you I tell you you will by no means see me until you say Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovahs name


On another occasion he went to eat a meal in the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath and they were closely watching him
And look a man who had dropsy was in front of him
So in response Jesus asked those versed in the Law and the Pharisees Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath or not
But they kept silent With that he took hold of the man healed him and sent him away
Then he said to them Who of you if his son or bull falls into a well will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day
And they were not able to reply to this
He then told the invited men an illustration when he noticed how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves He said to them
When you are invited by someone to a marriage feast do not recline in the most prominent place Perhaps someone more distinguished than you may also have been invited
Then the one who invited you both will come and say to you Let this man have your place Then you will proceed with shame to take the lowest place
But when you are invited go and recline in the lowest place so that when the man who invited you comes he will say to you Friend go on up higher Then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
Next he said also to the man who had invited him When you spread a dinner or an evening meal do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors Otherwise they might also invite you in return and it would become a repayment to you
But when you spread a feast invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind
and you will be happy because they have nothing with which to repay you For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones
On hearing these things one of the fellow guests said to him Happy is the one who dines in the Kingdom of God
Jesus said to him A man was spreading a grand evening meal and he invited many
He sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones Come because everything is now ready
But they all alike began to make excuses The first said to him I bought a field and need to go out and see it I ask you have me excused
And another said I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them I ask you have me excused
Still another said I just got married and for this reason I cannot come
So the slave came and reported these things to his master Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave Go out quickly to the main streets and the alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame
In time the slave said Master what you ordered has been done and still there is room
So the master said to the slave Go out to the roads and the lanes and compel them to come in so that my house may be filled
For I say to you none of those men who were invited will taste my evening meal
Now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple
Whoever does not carry his torture stake and come after me cannot be my disciple
For example who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it
Otherwise he might lay its foundation but not be able to finish it and all the onlookers would start to ridicule him
saying This man started to build but was not able to finish
Or what king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20000
If in fact he cannot do so then while that one is yet far away he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace
In the same way you may be sure that not one of you who does not say goodbye to all his belongings can be my disciple
Salt to be sure is fine But if the salt loses its strength with what will it be seasoned
It is not suitable for soil or for manure People throw it away Let the one who has ears to listen listen


Now all the tax collectors and the sinners kept gathering around him to hear him
And both the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering This man welcomes sinners and eats with them
Then he told them this illustration saying
What man among you with 100 sheep on losing one of them will not leave the 99 behind in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it
And when he has found it he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices
And when he gets home he calls his friends and his neighbors together saying to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep that was lost
I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance
Or what woman who has ten drachma coins if she loses one of the drachmas does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it
And when she has found it she calls her friends and neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the drachma coin that I had lost
In the same way I tell you joy arises among the angels of God over one sinner who repents
Then he said A man had two sons
And the younger one said to his father Father give me the share of the property that should come to me So he divided his belongings between them
A few days later the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched life
When he had spent everything a severe famine occurred throughout that country and he fell into need
He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to herd swine
And he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating but no one would give him anything
When he came to his senses he said How many of my fathers hired men have more than enough bread while I am dying here from hunger
I will get up and travel to my father and say to him Father I have sinned against heaven and against you
I am no longer worthy of being called your son Make me as one of your hired men
So he got up and went to his father While he was still a long way off his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him
Then the son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and against you I am no longer worthy of being called your son
But the father said to his slaves Quick bring out a robe the best one and clothe him with it and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
Also bring the fattened calf slaughter it and let us eat and celebrate
for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again he was lost and has been found And they started to enjoy themselves
Now his older son was in the field and as he returned and got near the house he heard music and dancing
So he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening
He said to him Your brother has come and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health
But he became angry and refused to go in Then his father came out and began to plead with him
In reply he said to his father Look These many years I have slaved for you and never once did I disobey your orders and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends
But as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered your belongings with prostitutes you slaughtered the fattened calf for him
Then he said to him My son you have always been with me and all the things that are mine are yours
But we just had to celebrate and rejoice for your brother was dead but has come to life he was lost and has been found


Then he also said to the disciples A rich man had a steward who was accused of handling his goods wastefully
So he called him and said What is this I hear about you Hand in the account of your stewardship for you can no longer manage the house
Then the steward said to himself What am I to do seeing that my master is taking the stewardship away from me I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg
Ah I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship people will welcome me into their homes
And calling to him each one of his masters debtors he said to the first How much do you owe my master
He replied A hundred measures of olive oil He said to him Take back your written agreement and sit down and quickly write 50
Next he said to another one Now you how much do you owe He said A hundred large measures of wheat He said to him Take back your written agreement and write 80
And his master commended the steward though unrighteous because he acted with practical wisdom for the sons of this system of things are wiser in a practical way toward their own generation than the sons of the light are
Also I say to you Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches so that when such fail they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places
The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much
Therefore if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches who will entrust you with what is true
And if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what belongs to another who will give you something for yourselves
No servant can be a slave to two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stick to the one and despise the other You cannot be slaves to God and to Riches
Now the Pharisees who were money lovers were listening to all these things and they began to sneer at him
So he said to them You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men but God knows your hearts For what is considered exalted by men is a disgusting thing in Gods sight
The Law and the Prophets were until John From then on the Kingdom of God is being declared as good news and every sort of person is pressing forward toward it
Indeed it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to go unfulfilled
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
There was a rich man who used to dress in purple and linen enjoying himself day after day with magnificence
But a beggar named Lazarus used to be put at his gate covered with ulcers
and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man Yes even the dogs would come and lick his ulcers
Now in the course of time the beggar died and was carried off by the angels to Abrahams side
Also the rich man died and was buried
And in the Grave he lifted up his eyes being in torment and he saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus by his side
So he called and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am in anguish in this blazing fire
But Abraham said Child remember that you had your fill of good things in your lifetime but Lazarus for his part received bad things Now however he is being comforted here but you are in anguish
And besides all these things a great chasm has been fixed between us and you so that those who want to go over from here to you cannot neither may people cross over from there to us
Then he said That being so I ask you father to send him to the house of my father
for I have five brothers in order that he may give them a thorough witness so that they will not also come into this place of torment
But Abraham said They have Moses and the Prophets let them listen to these
Then he said No indeed father Abraham but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent
But he said to him If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead


Then he said to his disciples It is unavoidable that causes for stumbling should come Nevertheless woe to the one through whom they come
It would be more advantageous for him if a millstone were hung from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones
Pay attention to yourselves If your brother commits a sin rebuke him and if he repents forgive him
Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times saying I repent you must forgive him
Now the apostles said to the Lord Give us more faith
Then the Lord said If you had faith the size of a mustard grain you would say to this black mulberry tree Be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
Which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field Come here at once and dine at the table
Rather will he not say to him Get something ready for me to have my evening meal and put on an apron and serve me until I finish eating and drinking and afterward you can eat and drink
He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned will he
Likewise when you have done all the things assigned to you say We are goodfornothing slaves What we have done is what we ought to have done
While he was going to Jerusalem he was passing between Samaria and Galilee
And as he was entering a village ten men with leprosy met him but they stood at a distance
And they raised their voices and said Jesus Instructor have mercy on us
When he saw them he said to them Go and show yourselves to the priests Then as they were going off they were cleansed
One of them when he saw that he was healed turned back glorifying God with a loud voice
And he fell facedown at Jesus feet thanking him Furthermore he was a Samaritan
In reply Jesus said All ten were cleansed were they not Where then are the other nine
Did no one else turn back to give glory to God except this man of another nation
Then he said to him Get up and be on your way your faith has made you well
On being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming he answered them The Kingdom of God is not coming with striking observableness
nor will people say See here or There For look the Kingdom of God is in your midst
Then he said to the disciples Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man but you will not see it
And people will say to you See there or See here Do not go out or chase after them
For just as lightning flashes from one part of heaven to another part of heaven so the Son of man will be in his day
First however he must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by this generation
Moreover just as it occurred in the days of Noah so it will be in the days of the Son of man
they were eating they were drinking men were marrying women were being given in marriage until that day when Noah entered into the ark and the Flood came and destroyed them all
Likewise just as it occurred in the days of Lot they were eating they were drinking they were buying they were selling they were planting they were building
But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all
It will be the same on that day when the Son of man is revealed
On that day let the person who is on the housetop but whose belongings are in the house not come down to pick these up and likewise the person out in the field must not return to the things behind
Remember the wife of Lot
Whoever seeks to keep his life safe will lose it but whoever loses it will preserve it alive
I tell you in that night two people will be in one bed the one will be taken along but the other will be abandoned
There will be two women grinding at the same mill the one will be taken along but the other will be abandoned

So in response they said to him Where Lord He said to them Where the body is there also the eagles will be gathered together


Then he went on to tell them an illustration about the need for them always to pray and not to give up
saying In a certain city there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man
There was also a widow in that city who kept going to him and saying See that I get justice from my legal opponent
Well for a while he was unwilling but afterward he said to himself Although I do not fear God or respect any man
because this widow keeps making me trouble I will see that she gets justice so that she will not keep coming and wearing me out with her demand
Then the Lord said Hear what the judge although unrighteous said
Certainly then will not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night while he is patient toward them
I tell you he will cause justice to be done to them speedily Nevertheless when the Son of man arrives will he really find this faith on the earth
He also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness and who considered others as nothing
Two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector
The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself O God I thank you that I am not like everyone elseextortioners unrighteous adulterersor even like this tax collector
I fast twice a week I give the tenth of all things I acquire
But the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward but kept beating his chest saying O God be gracious to me a sinner
I tell you this man went down to his home and was proved more righteous than that Pharisee Because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated but whoever humbles himself will be exalted
Now people were also bringing him their infants for him to touch them but on seeing this the disciples began to reprimand them
However Jesus called the infants to him saying Let the young children come to me and do not try to stop them for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones
Truly I say to you whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it
And one of the rulers questioned him saying Good Teacher what must I do to inherit everlasting life
Jesus said to him Why do you call me good Nobody is good except one God
You know the commandments Do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not bear false witness honor your father and your mother
Then he said All of these I have kept from youth on
After hearing that Jesus said to him There is still one thing lacking about you Sell all the things you have and distribute the proceeds to the poor and you will have treasure in the heavens and come be my follower
When he heard this he became deeply grieved for he was very rich
Jesus looked at him and said How difficult it will be for those having money to make their way into the Kingdom of God
It is easier in fact for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God
Those who heard this said Who possibly can be saved
He said The things impossible with men are possible with God
But Peter said Look We have left what was ours and followed you
He said to them Truly I say to you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God
who will not get many times more in this period of time and in the coming system of things everlasting life
Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them Look We are going up to Jerusalem and all the things written by means of the prophets about the Son of man will be accomplished
For instance he will be handed over to men of the nations and will be mocked and treated insolently and spat on
And after scourging him they will kill him but on the third day he will rise
However they did not get the meaning of any of these things for these words were hidden from them and they did not understand the things said
Now as Jesus was getting near to Jericho a blind man was sitting beside the road begging
Because he heard a crowd passing by he began to inquire what was going on
They reported to him Jesus the Nazarene is passing by
At that he cried out Jesus Son of David have mercy on me
And those who were in front began rebuking him telling him to keep quiet but all the more he kept shouting Son of David have mercy on me
Then Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him After he came near Jesus asked him
What do you want me to do for you He said Lord let me recover my sight
So Jesus said to him Recover your sight your faith has made you well
And instantly he recovered his sight and he began to follow him glorifying God Also at seeing it all the people gave praise to God


He then entered Jericho and was passing through
Now a man named Zacchaeus was there he was a chief tax collector and he was rich
Well he was trying to see who this Jesus was but he could not see because of the crowd since he was short
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him for he was about to pass that way
Now when Jesus got to the place he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus hurry and get down for today I must stay in your house
With that he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest
When they saw this they were all muttering He went as a guest to the house of a man who is a sinner
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord Look The half of my belongings Lord I am giving to the poor and whatever I extorted from anyone I am restoring four times over
At this Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of Abraham
For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost
While they were listening to these things he told another illustration because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to appear instantly
So he said A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return
Calling ten of his slaves he gave them ten minas and told them Do business with these until I come
But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say We do not want this man to become king over us
When he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity
So the first one came forward and said Lord your mina gained ten minas
He said to him Well done good slave Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful hold authority over ten cities
Now the second came saying Your mina Lord made five minas
He said to this one as well You too be in charge of five cities
But another one came saying Lord here is your mina that I kept hidden away in a cloth
You see I was in fear of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and you reap what you did not sow
He said to him By your own words I judge you wicked slave You knew did you that I am a harsh man taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow
So why did you not put my money in a bank Then on my coming I would have collected it with interest
With that he said to those standing by Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas
But they said to him Lord he has ten minas
I say to you to everyone who has more will be given but from the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away
Moreover bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me
After he had said these things he went on ahead going up to Jerusalem
And when he got near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called Mount of Olives he sent two of the disciples
saying Go into the village that is within sight and after you enter it you will find a colt tied on which no man has ever sat Untie it and bring it here
But if anyone asks you Why are you untying it you must say The Lord needs it
So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them
But as they were untying the colt its owners said to them Why are you untying the colt
They said The Lord needs it
And they led it to Jesus and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated Jesus on it
As he moved along they were spreading their outer garments on the road
As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen
saying Blessed is the one coming as the King in Jehovahs name Peace in heaven and glory in the heights above
However some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him Teacher rebuke your disciples
But in reply he said I tell you if these remained silent the stones would cry out
And when he got nearby he viewed the city and wept over it
saying If you even you had discerned on this day the things having to do with peacebut now they have been hidden from your eyes
Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege you from every side
They will dash you and your children within you to the ground and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you because you did not discern the time of your being inspected
Then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling
saying to them It is written My house will be a house of prayer but you have made it a cave of robbers
He continued teaching daily in the temple But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him
but they did not find any way to do this for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him


On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came
and said to him Tell us by what authority do you do these things Or who gave you this authority
He replied to them I will also ask you a question and you tell me
Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men
Then they drew conclusions among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why did you not believe him
But if we say From men the people one and all will stone us for they are convinced that John was a prophet
So they replied that they did not know its source
Jesus said to them Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things
Then he began to tell the people this illustration A man planted a vineyard and leased it to cultivators and he traveled abroad for a considerable time
In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard The cultivators however sent him away emptyhanded after beating him
But again he sent another slave That one also they beat and humiliated and sent away emptyhanded
Yet again he sent a third this one also they wounded and threw out
At this the owner of the vineyard said What should I do I will send my son the beloved They will likely respect this one
When the cultivators caught sight of him they reasoned with one another saying This is the heir Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them
He will come and kill these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others
On hearing this they said Never may that happen
But he looked straight at them and said What then does this mean where it is written The stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone
Everyone falling on that stone will be shattered As for anyone on whom it falls it will crush him
The scribes and the chief priests then sought to get their hands on him in that very hour but they feared the people for they realized that he told this illustration with them in mind
And after observing him closely they sent men whom they had secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous in order to catch him in his speech so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor
And they questioned him saying Teacher we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality but you teach the way of God in line with truth
Is it lawful for us to pay head tax to Caesar or not
But he detected their cunning and said to them
Show me a denarius Whose image and inscription does it have They said Caesars
He said to them By all means then pay back Caesars things to Caesar but Gods things to God
Well they were not able to trap him in his speech before the people but amazed at his answer they became silent
However some of the Sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
Teacher Moses wrote us If a mans brother dies leaving a wife but he was childless his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother
Now there were seven brothers The first took a wife but died childless
So the second
and the third married her Likewise even all seven they died and left no children
Finally the woman also died
Consequently in the resurrection whose wife will she become For the seven had her as a wife
Jesus said to them The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage
but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
In fact neither can they die anymore for they are like the angels and they are Gods children by being children of the resurrection
But that the dead are raised up even Moses made known in the account about the thornbush when he calls Jehovah the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob
He is a God not of the dead but of the living for they are all living to him
In response some of the scribes said Teacher you spoke well
For they no longer had the courage to ask him a single question
In turn he asked them How is it they say that the Christ is Davids son
For David himself says in the book of Psalms Jehovah said to my Lord Sit at my right hand
until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet
David therefore calls him Lord so how is he his son
Then while all the people were listening he said to his disciples
Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals
and who devour the houses of the widows and for show make long prayers These will receive a more severe judgment


Now as he looked up he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests
Then he saw a needy widow drop in two small coins of very little value
and he said Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than they all did
For all of these put in gifts out of their surplus but she out of her want put in all the means of living she had
Later when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with fine stones and dedicated things
he said As for these things that you now see the days will come when not a stone will be left upon a stone and not be thrown down
Then they questioned him saying Teacher when will these things actually be and what will be the sign when these things are to occur
He said Look out that you are not misled for many will come on the basis of my name saying I am he and The due time is near Do not go after them
Furthermore when you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified For these things must take place first but the end will not occur immediately
Then he said to them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
There will be great earthquakes and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs
But before all these things happen people will lay their hands on you and persecute you handing you over to the synagogues and prisons You will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name
It will result in your giving a witness
Therefore resolve in your hearts not to rehearse beforehand how to make your defense
for I will give you words and wisdom that all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute
Moreover you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
and you will be hated by all people because of my name
But not even a hair of your heads will perish
By your endurance you will preserve your lives
However when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies then know that the desolating of her has drawn near
Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains let those in the midst of her leave and let those in the countryside not enter into her
because these are days for meting out justice in order that all the things written may be fulfilled
Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days For there will be great distress on the land and wrath against this people
And they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled
Also there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars and on the earth anguish of nations not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation
People will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth for the powers of the heavens will be shaken
And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
But as these things start to occur stand up straight and lift up your heads because your deliverance is getting near
With that he told them an illustration Notice the fig tree and all the other trees
When they are budding you see it for yourselves and know that now the summer is near
Likewise also you when you see these things happening know that the Kingdom of God is near
Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all things happen
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
But pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life and suddenly that day be instantly upon you
as a snare For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth
Keep awake then all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the Son of man
So by day he would be teaching in the temple but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the Mount of Olives
And all the people would come to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple


Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread which is called Passover was getting near
And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him because they were afraid of the people
Then Satan entered into Judas the one called Iscariot who was numbered among the Twelve
and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them
They were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money
So he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around
The first day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered
so Jesus sent Peter and John saying Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat
They said to him Where do you want us to get it ready
He said to them Look When you enter into the city a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you Follow him into the house that he enters
And say to the landlord of the house The Teacher says to you Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room Get it ready there
So they left and found it just as he had told them and they prepared for the Passover
So when the hour came he reclined at the table along with the apostles
And he said to them I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer
for I tell you I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God
And accepting a cup he gave thanks and said Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves
for I tell you from now on I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes
Also he took a loaf gave thanks broke it and gave it to them saying This means my body which is to be given in your behalf Keep doing this in remembrance of me
Also he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal saying This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood which is to be poured out in your behalf
But look the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table
For indeed the Son of man is going his way according to what has been determined all the same woe to that man through whom he is betrayed
So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this
However there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest
But he said to them The kings of the nations lord it over them and those having authority over them are called Benefactors
You though are not to be that way But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest and the one taking the lead as the one ministering
For which one is greater the one dining or the one serving Is it not the one dining But I am among you as the one serving
However you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials
and I make a covenant with you just as my Father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel
Simon Simon look Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat
But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out and you once you have returned strengthen your brothers
Then he said to him Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death
But he said I tell you Peter a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times
He also said to them When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals you did not lack anything did you They said No
Then he said to them But now let the one who has a money bag take it likewise a food pouch and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one
For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me namely He was counted with lawless ones For this is being fulfilled concerning me
Then they said Lord look here are two swords He said to them It is enough
On leaving he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives and the disciples also followed him
On arriving at the place he said to them Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation
And he withdrew from them about a stones throw away and he bent his knees and began to pray
saying Father if you want to remove this cup from me Nevertheless let not my will but yours take place
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him
But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground
When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples he found them slumbering exhausted from grief
He said to them Why are you sleeping Get up and keep praying so that you do not enter into temptation
While he was still speaking look a crowd and the man called Judas one of the Twelve was leading them and he approached Jesus to kiss him
But Jesus said to him Judas are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss
When those around him saw what was going to happen they said Lord should we strike with the sword
One of them even struck the slave of the high priest taking off his right ear
But in reply Jesus said That is enough And he touched the ear and healed him
Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber
While I was with you in the temple day after day you did not lay your hands on me But this is your hour and the authority of darkness
Then they arrested him and led him off and they brought him into the house of the high priest but Peter was following at a distance
When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together Peter was sitting among them
But a servant girl seeing him sitting in the light of the fire looked closely at him and said This man was also with him
But he denied it saying I do not know him woman
After a short time another person saw him and said You too are one of them But Peter said Man I am not
And after about an hour had passed another man began insisting strongly Certainly this man was also with him for he is in fact a Galilean
But Peter said Man I do not know what you are saying And instantly while he was still speaking a rooster crowed
At this the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord when he had said to him Before a rooster crows today you will disown me three times
And he went outside and wept bitterly
Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him hitting him
and after covering his face they kept asking Prophesy Who is it that struck you
And they said many other blasphemous things against him
And when it became day the assembly of elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they led him into their Sanhedrin hall and said
If you are the Christ tell us But he said to them Even if I told you you would not believe it at all
Moreover if I questioned you you would not answer
However from now on the Son of man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God
At this they all said Are you therefore the Son of God He said to them You yourselves are saying that I am
They said Why do we need further testimony For we ourselves have heard it out of his own mouth


So the multitude got up one and all and led him to Pilate
Then they began to accuse him saying We found this man subverting our nation forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar and saying he himself is Christ a king
Now Pilate asked him the question Are you the King of the Jews In answer he said You yourself are saying it
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds I find no crime in this man
But they insisted saying He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea starting from Galilee even to here
On hearing that Pilate asked whether the man was a Galilean
After ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of Herod he sent him on to Herod who was also in Jerusalem in those days
When Herod saw Jesus he rejoiced greatly For a considerable time he had been wanting to see Jesus because he had heard much about him and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him
So he began to question him at length but he gave him no answer
However the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him
Then Herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to Pilate
Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that very day for before that they had been at enmity with each other
Pilate then called together the chief priests the rulers and the people
and said to them You brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt Now look I examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him
In fact neither did Herod for he sent him back to us and look he has done nothing deserving of death
I will therefore punish him and release him

But the whole crowd shouted out Do away with this man and release Barabbas to us
This man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder
Again Pilate called out to them because he wanted to release Jesus
Then they began to yell saying To the stake with him To the stake with him
The third time he said to them Why What bad thing did this man do I found in him nothing deserving of death I will therefore punish him and release him
At this they became insistent demanding with loud voices that he be executed and their voices prevailed
So Pilate made the decision that their demand be met
He released the man whom they were demanding who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder but he surrendered Jesus to their will
Now as they led him away they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene who was coming from the countryside and they placed the torture stake on him to carry it behind Jesus
A large number of people were following him including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him
Jesus turned to the women and said Daughters of Jerusalem stop weeping for me Weep instead for yourselves and for your children
for look days are coming when people will say Happy are the barren women the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse
Then they will start saying to the mountains Fall over us and to the hills Cover us over
If they do these things when the tree is moist what will occur when it is withered
Two other men criminals were also being led off to be executed with him
And when they got to the place called Skull they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals one on his right and one on his left
But Jesus was saying Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing Furthermore they cast lots to distribute his garments
And the people stood looking on But the rulers were sneering and saying Others he saved let him save himself if he is the Christ of God the Chosen One
Even the soldiers mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine
and saying If you are the King of the Jews save yourself
There was also an inscription over him This is the King of the Jews
Then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him saying You are the Christ are you not Save yourself and us too
In response the other rebuked him saying Do you not fear God at all now that you have received the same judgment
And we rightly so for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did but this man did nothing wrong
Then he said Jesus remember me when you get into your Kingdom
And he said to him Truly I tell you today you will be with me in Paradise
Well by now it was about the sixth hour and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
because the sunlight failed then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle
And Jesus called out with a loud voice and said Father into your hands I entrust my spirit After he said this he expired
Because of seeing what occurred the army officer began to glorify God saying Truly this man was righteous
And when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw the things that occurred they returned home beating their chests
And all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance Also women who had accompanied him from Galilee were there and saw these things
And look there was a man named Joseph a member of the Council who was a good and righteous man
This man had not voted in support of their scheme and action He was from Arimathea a city of the Judeans and was waiting for the Kingdom of God
This man went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus
And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen and he laid it in a tomb carved in the rock where no man had yet lain
Now it was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin
But the women who had come with him from Galilee followed along and took a look at the tomb and saw how his body was laid
and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils But of course they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment


But on the first day of the week they came very early to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared
But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
and when they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus
While they were perplexed about this look two men in shining garments stood by them
The women became frightened and kept their faces turned toward the ground so the men said to them Why are you looking for the living one among the dead
He is not here but has been raised up Recall how he spoke to you while he was yet in Galilee
saying that the Son of man must be handed over to sinful men and be executed on the stake and on the third day rise
Then they remembered his words
and they returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest
They were Mary Magdalene Joanna and Mary the mother of James Also the rest of the women with them were telling these things to the apostles
However these sayings seemed like nonsense to them and they would not believe the women
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb and stooping forward he saw only the linen cloths So he went off wondering to himself what had occurred
But look on that very day two of them were traveling to a village named Emmaus about eleven kilometers seven miles from Jerusalem
and they were conversing with each other about all these things that had happened
Now as they were conversing and discussing these things Jesus himself approached and began walking with them
but their eyes were kept from recognizing him
He said to them What are these matters that you are debating between yourselves as you walk along And they stood still looking sad
In answer the one named Cleopas said to him Are you a stranger dwelling alone in Jerusalem and do not know the things that have occurred there during these days
He asked them What things They said to him The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene who proved to be a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people
and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and they nailed him to the stake
But we were hoping that this man was the one who was going to deliver Israel Yes and besides all these things this is the third day since these things occurred
Moreover some women from among us also astonished us for they went early to the tomb
and when they did not find his body they came saying that they had also seen a supernatural sight of angels who said he is alive
Then some of those who were with us went off to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said but they did not see him
So he said to them O senseless ones and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory
And starting with Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures
Finally they got close to the village to which they were traveling and he made as if to travel on farther
But they urged him to remain saying Stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over With that he went in to stay with them
And as he was dining with them he took the bread blessed it broke it and began handing it to them
At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him but he disappeared from them
And they said to each other Were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us
And they got up in that very hour and returned to Jerusalem and they found the Eleven and those assembled together with them
who said For a fact the Lord was raised up and he appeared to Simon
Then they related the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the bread
While they were speaking of these things he himself stood in their midst and said to them May you have peace
But because they were terrified and frightened they imagined that they were seeing a spirit
So he said to them Why are you troubled and why have doubts come up in your hearts
See my hands and my feet that it is I myself touch me and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that I have
And as he said this he showed them his hands and his feet
But while they were still not believing for sheer joy and amazement he said to them Do you have something there to eat
So they handed him a piece of broiled fish
and he took it and ate it before their eyes
He then said to them These are my words that I spoke to you while I was yet with you that all the things written about me in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms must be fulfilled
Then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures
and he said to them This is what is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from among the dead on the third day
and on the basis of his name repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nationsstarting out from Jerusalem
You are to be witnesses of these things
And look I am sending upon you what my Father promised You though stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high
Then he led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them
As he was blessing them he was parted from them and taken up to heaven
And they did obeisance to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy
And they were continually in the temple praising God


In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was a god
This one was in the beginning with God
All things came into existence through him and apart from him not even one thing came into existence
What has come into existence
by means of him was life and the life was the light of men
And the light is shining in the darkness but the darkness has not overpowered it
There came a man who was sent as a representative of God his name was John
This man came as a witness in order to bear witness about the light so that people of all sorts might believe through him
He was not that light but he was meant to bear witness about that light
The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world
He was in the world and the world came into existence through him but the world did not know him
He came to his own home but his own people did not accept him
However to all who did receive him he gave authority to become Gods children because they were exercising faith in his name
And they were born not from blood or from a fleshly will or from mans will but from God
So the Word became flesh and resided among us and we had a view of his glory a glory such as belongs to an onlybegotten son from a father and he was full of divine favor and truth
John bore witness about him yes he cried out This was the one of whom I said The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me for he existed before me
For we all received from his fullness even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness
Because the Law was given through Moses the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ
No man has seen God at any time the onlybegotten god who is at the Fathers side is the one who has explained Him
This is the witness John gave when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who are you
And he admitted it and did not deny it saying I am not the Christ
And they asked him What then Are you Elijah He replied I am not Are you the Prophet And he answered No
So they said to him Who are you Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us What do you say about yourself
He said I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness Make the way of Jehovah straight just as Isaiah the prophet said
Now those sent were from the Pharisees
So they questioned him and said to him Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet
John answered them I baptize in water One is standing among you whom you do not know
the one coming behind me the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie
These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing
The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and he said See the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
This is the one about whom I said Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me for he existed before me
Even I did not know him but the reason why I came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to Israel
John also bore witness saying I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven and it remained upon him
Even I did not know him but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit
And I have seen it and I have given witness that this one is the Son of God
Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples
and as he looked at Jesus walking he said See the Lamb of God
When the two disciples heard him say this they followed Jesus
Then Jesus turned and seeing them following he said to them What are you looking for They said to him Rabbi which means when translated Teacher where are you staying
He said to them Come and you will see So they went and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day it was about the tenth hour
Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus
He first found his own brother Simon and said to him We have found the Messiah which means when translated Christ
and he led him to Jesus When Jesus looked at him he said You are Simon the son of John you will be called Cephas which is translated Peter
The next day he wanted to leave for Galilee Jesus then found Philip and said to him Be my follower
Now Philip was from Bethsaida from the city of Andrew and Peter
Philip found Nathanael and said to him We have found the one of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote Jesus the son of Joseph from Nazareth
But Nathanael said to him Can anything good come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him See truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit
Nathanael said to him How do you know me Jesus answered him Before Philip called you while you were under the fig tree I saw you
Nathanael responded Rabbi you are the Son of God you are King of Israel
Jesus answered him Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree You will see things greater than these
He then said to him Most truly I say to you men you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man


And on the third day a marriage feast took place in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there
Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast
When the wine ran short the mother of Jesus said to him They have no wine
But Jesus said to her Woman why is that of concern to me and to you My hour has not yet come
His mother said to those serving Do whatever he tells you
Now there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews each able to hold two or three liquid measures
Jesus said to them Fill the jars with water So they filled them to the brim
Then he said to them Now draw some out and take it to the director of the feast So they took it
When the director of the feast tasted the water that had now been turned into wine not knowing where it came from although the servants who had drawn out the water knew the director of the feast called the bridegroom
and said to him Everyone else puts out the fine wine first and when people are intoxicated the inferior You have saved the fine wine until now
Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs and he made his glory manifest and his disciples put their faith in him
After this he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum but they did not stay there many days
Now the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
He found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats
So after making a whip of ropes he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables
And he said to those selling the doves Take these things away from here Stop making the house of my Father a house of commerce
His disciples recalled that it is written The zeal for your house will consume me
Therefore in response the Jews said to him What sign can you show us since you are doing these things
Jesus replied to them Tear down this temple and in three days I will raise it up
The Jews then said This temple was built in 46 years and will you raise it up in three days
But he was talking about the temple of his body
When though he was raised up from the dead his disciples recalled that he used to say this and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had spoken
However when he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the Passover many people put their faith in his name when they saw the signs that he was performing
But Jesus would not entrust himself to them because he knew them all
and because he did not need to have anyone bear witness about man for he knew what was in man


There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews
This one came to him in the night and said to him Rabbi we know that you have come from God as a teacher for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him
In response Jesus said to him Most truly I say to you unless anyone is born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God
Nicodemus said to him How can a man be born when he is old He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born can he
Jesus answered Most truly I say to you unless anyone is born from water and spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God
What has been born from the flesh is flesh and what has been born from the spirit is spirit
Do not be amazed because I told you You people must be born again
The wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit
In answer Nicodemus said to him How can these things be
Jesus replied Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things
Most truly I say to you what we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness to but you do not receive the witness we give
If I have told you earthly things and you still do not believe how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things
Moreover no man has ascended into heaven but the one who descended from heaven the Son of man
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so the Son of man must be lifted up
so that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life
For God loved the world so much that he gave his onlybegotten Son so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life
For God did not send his Son into the world for him to judge the world but for the world to be saved through him
Whoever exercises faith in him is not to be judged Whoever does not exercise faith has been judged already because he has not exercised faith in the name of the onlybegotten Son of God
Now this is the basis for judgment that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were wicked
For whoever practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light so that his works may not be reproved
But whoever does what is true comes to the light so that his works may be made manifest as having been done in harmony with God
After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside and there he spent some time with them and was baptizing
But John too was baptizing in Aenon near Salim because there was a great quantity of water there and people kept coming and were being baptized
for John had not yet been thrown into prison
Now the disciples of John had a dispute with a Jew concerning purification
So they came to John and said to him Rabbi the man who was with you across the Jordan about whom you bore witness see this one is baptizing and all are going to him
In answer John said A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven
You yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but I have been sent ahead of that one
Whoever has the bride is the bridegroom But the friend of the bridegroom when he stands and hears him has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom So my joy has been made complete
That one must keep on increasing but I must keep on decreasing
The one who comes from above is over all others The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth The one who comes from heaven is over all others
He bears witness to what he has seen and heard but no man accepts his witness
Whoever has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that God is true
For the one whom God sent speaks the sayings of God for He does not give the spirit sparingly
The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand
The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life the one who disobeys the Son will not see life but the wrath of God remains upon him


When the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
although Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did
he left Judea and departed again for Galilee
But it was necessary for him to go through Samaria
So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph
In fact Jacobs well was there Now Jesus tired out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well It was about the sixth hour
A woman of Samaria came to draw water Jesus said to her Give me a drink
For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food
So the Samaritan woman said to him How is it that you despite being a Jew ask me for a drink even though I am a Samaritan woman For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans
In answer Jesus said to her If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you Give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
She said to him Sir you do not even have a bucket for drawing water and the well is deep From what source then do you have this living water
You are not greater than our forefather Jacob who gave us the well and who together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it are you
In answer Jesus said to her Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again
Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life
The woman said to him Sir give me this water so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water
He said to her Go call your husband and come to this place
The woman replied I do not have a husband Jesus said to her You are right in saying I do not have a husband
For you have had five husbands and the man you now have is not your husband This you have said truthfully
The woman said to him Sir I see that you are a prophet
Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship
Jesus said to her Believe me woman the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
You worship what you do not know we worship what we know because salvation begins with the Jews
Nevertheless the hour is coming and it is now when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth for indeed the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him
God is a Spirit and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth
The woman said to him I know that Messiah is coming who is called Christ Whenever that one comes he will declare all things to us openly
Jesus said to her I am he the one speaking to you
Just then his disciples arrived and they were surprised because he was speaking with a woman Of course no one said What are you looking for or Why are you talking to her
So the woman left her water jar and went off into the city and told the people
Come and see a man who told me everything I did Could this not perhaps be the Christ
They left the city and began coming to him
Meanwhile the disciples were urging him Rabbi eat
But he said to them I have food to eat that you do not know about
So the disciples said to one another No one brought him anything to eat did he
Jesus said to them My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work
Do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes Look I say to you Lift up your eyes and view the fields that they are white for harvesting Already
the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together
For in this respect the saying is true One is the sower and another the reaper
I sent you to reap what you did not labor on Others have labored and you have entered into the benefit of their labor
Many of the Samaritans from that city put faith in him because of the word of the woman who bore witness saying He told me all the things I did
So when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days
As a result many more believed because of what he said
and they said to the woman We no longer believe just because of what you said for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world
After the two days he left there for Galilee
Jesus himself however bore witness that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland
So when he arrived in Galilee the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival
Then he came again to Cana of Galilee where he had turned the water into wine Now there was a royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum
When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of dying
But Jesus said to him Unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe
The royal official said to him Lord come down before my young child dies
Jesus said to him Go your way your son lives The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he left
But while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive
So he asked them at what hour he got better They replied to him The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour
The father then knew that it was in the very hour that Jesus had said to him Your son lives So he and his whole household believed
This was the second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee


After this there was a festival of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Now in Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate is a pool called in Hebrew iBethzathai with five colonnades
Within these a multitude of the sick blind lame and those with withered limbs were lying down

But one man was there who had been sick for 38 years
Seeing this man lying there and being aware that he had already been sick for a long time Jesus said to him Do you want to get well
The sick man answered him Sir I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while I am on my way another steps down ahead of me
Jesus said to him Get up Pick up your mat and walk
And the man immediately got well and he picked up his mat and began to walk
That day was the Sabbath
So the Jews began to say to the cured man It is the Sabbath and it is not lawful for you to carry the mat
But he answered them The same one who made me well said to me Pick up your mat and walk
They asked him Who is the man who told you Pick it up and walk
But the healed man did not know who he was for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there
After this Jesus found him in the temple and said to him See you have become well Do not sin anymore so that something worse does not happen to you
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well
For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things during the Sabbath
But he answered them My Father has kept working until now and I keep working
This is why the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father making himself equal to God
Therefore in response Jesus said to them Most truly I say to you the Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative but only what he sees the Father doing For whatever things that One does these things the Son does also in like manner
For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does and he will show him works greater than these so that you may marvel
For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive so the Son also makes alive whomever he wants to
For the Father judges no one at all but he has entrusted all the judging to the Son
so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him
Most truly I say to you whoever hears my word and believes the One who sent me has everlasting life and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life
Most truly I say to you the hour is coming and it is now when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have paid attention will live
For just as the Father has life in himself so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself
And he has given him authority to do judging because he is the Son of man
Do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice
and come out those who did good things to a resurrection of life and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment
I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative Just as I hear I judge and my judgment is righteous because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me
If I alone bear witness about myself my witness is not true
There is another who bears witness about me and I know that the witness he bears about me is true
You have sent men to John and he has borne witness to the truth
However I do not accept the witness from man but I say these things so that you may be saved
That man was a burning and shining lamp and for a short time you were willing to rejoice greatly in his light
But I have the witness greater than that of John for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish these works that I am doing bear witness that the Father sent me
And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form
and you do not have his word residing in you because you do not believe the very one whom he sent
You are searching the Scriptures because you think that you will have everlasting life by means of them and these are the very ones that bear witness about me
And yet you do not want to come to me so that you may have life
I do not accept glory from men
but I well know that you do not have the love of God in you
I have come in the name of my Father but you do not receive me If someone else came in his own name you would receive that one
How can you believe when you are accepting glory from one another and you are not seeking the glory that is from the only God
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father there is one who accuses you Moses in whom you have put your hope
In fact if you believed Moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
But if you do not believe his writings how will you believe what I say


After this Jesus set out across the Sea of Galilee or Tiberias
And a large crowd kept following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick
So Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples
Now the Passover the festival of the Jews was near
When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him he said to Philip Where will we buy bread for these people to eat
However he was saying this to test him for he knew what he was about to do
Philip answered him Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little
One of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother said to him
Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish But what are these among so many
Jesus said Have the men sit down As there was a lot of grass in that place the men sat down there about 5000 in number
Jesus took the bread and after giving thanks he distributed it to those who were sitting there he did likewise with the small fish and they had as much as they wanted
But when they had eaten their fill he said to his disciples Gather together the fragments left over so that nothing is wasted
So they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves
When the people saw the sign he performed they began to say This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world
Then Jesus knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king withdrew again to the mountain all alone
When evening fell his disciples went down to the sea
and boarding a boat they set out across the sea for Capernaum By now it had grown dark and Jesus had not yet come to them
Also the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing
 measurements
However when they had rowed about five or six kilometers three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat and they became fearful
But he said to them It is I do not be afraid
Then they were willing to take him into the boat and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading
The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except a small one and that Jesus had not boarded the boat with his disciples but his disciples had left by themselves
Boats from Tiberias however arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks
So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there they boarded their boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus
When they found him across the sea they said to him Rabbi when did you get here
Jesus answered them Most truly I say to you you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied
Work not for the food that perishes but for the food that remains for everlasting life which the Son of man will give you for on this one the Father God himself has put his seal of approval
So they said to him What must we do to carry out the works of God
In answer Jesus said to them This is the work of God that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent
Then they said to him What are you performing as a sign so that we may see it and believe you What work are you doing
Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness just as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eat
Jesus then said to them Most truly I say to you Moses did not give you the bread from heaven but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven
For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
So they said to him Lord always give us this bread
Jesus said to them I am the bread of life Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all
But as I said to you you have even seen me and yet do not believe
All those whom the Father gives me will come to me and I will never drive away the one who comes to me
for I have come down from heaven to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me
This is the will of him who sent me that I should lose none out of all those whom he has given me but that I should resurrect them on the last day
For this is the will of my Father that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life and I will resurrect him on the last day
Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he had said I am the bread that came down from heaven
And they began saying Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How does he now say I have come down from heaven
In response Jesus said to them Stop murmuring among yourselves
No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him and I will resurrect him on the last day
It is written in the Prophets They will all be taught by Jehovah Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned comes to me
Not that any man has seen the Father except the one who is from God this one has seen the Father
Most truly I say to you whoever believes has everlasting life
I am the bread of life
Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died
This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die
I am the living bread that came down from heaven If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and for a fact the bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world
Then the Jews began to argue with one another saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat
So Jesus said to them Most truly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you have no life in yourselves
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will resurrect him on the last day
for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me and I in union with him
Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me
This is the bread that came down from heaven It is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever
He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum
When they heard this many of his disciples said This speech is shocking who can listen to it
But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this said to them Does this stumble you
What therefore if you should see the Son of man ascending to where he was before
It is the spirit that is lifegiving the flesh is of no use at all The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life
But there are some of you who do not believe For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him
He went on to say This is why I have said to you no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father
Because of this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him
So Jesus said to the Twelve You do not want to go also do you
Simon Peter answered him Lord whom shall we go away to You have sayings of everlasting life
We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God
Jesus answered them I chose you twelve did I not Yet one of you is a slanderer
He was in fact speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot for this one was going to betray him although he was one of the Twelve


After this Jesus continued traveling about in Galilee for he did not want to do so in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him
However the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near
So his brothers said to him Leave here and go into Judea so that your disciples may also see the works you are doing
For no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly If you are doing these things show yourself to the world
His brothers were in fact not exercising faith in him
So Jesus said to them My time has not yet arrived but your time is always at hand
The world has no reason to hate you but it hates me because I bear witness about it that its works are wicked
You go up to the festival I am not yet going up to this festival because my time has not yet fully come
So after he told them these things he remained in Galilee
But when his brothers had gone up to the festival then he also went up not openly but in secret
So the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying Where is that man
And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds Some would say He is a good man Others would say He is not He misleads the crowd
Of course no one would speak about him publicly because of fear of the Jews
When the festival was half over Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching
And the Jews were astonished saying How does this man have such a knowledge of the Scriptures when he has not studied at the schools
Jesus in turn answered them and said What I teach is not mine but belongs to him who sent me
If anyone desires to do His will he will know whether the teaching is from God or I speak of my own originality
Whoever speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him this one is true and there is no unrighteousness in him
Moses gave you the Law did he not But not one of you obeys the Law Why are you seeking to kill me
The crowd answered You have a demon Who is seeking to kill you
In answer Jesus said to them One deed I performed and you are all surprised
For this reason Moses has given you circumcisionnot that it is from Moses but it is from the forefathersand you circumcise a man on a sabbath
If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken are you violently angry at me because I made a man completely well on a sabbath
Stop judging by the outward appearance but judge with righteous judgment
Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say This is the man they are seeking to kill is it not
And yet see he is speaking in public and they say nothing to him Have the rulers come to know for certain that this is the Christ
On the contrary we know where this man is from yet when the Christ comes no one is to know where he is from
Then as he was teaching in the temple Jesus called out You know me and you know where I am from And I have not come of my own initiative but the One who sent me is real and you do not know him
I know him because I am a representative from him and that One sent me
So they began seeking to get hold of him but no one laid a hand on him for his hour had not yet come
Still many of the crowd put faith in him and they were saying When the Christ comes he will not perform more signs than this man has done will he
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him
Jesus then said I will be with you a little while longer before I go to the One who sent me
You will look for me but you will not find me and where I am you cannot come
Therefore the Jews said among themselves Where does this man intend to go so that we will not find him He does not intend to go to the Jews dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks does he
What does he mean when he says You will look for me but you will not find me and where I am you cannot come
On the last day the great day of the festival Jesus stood up and he called out If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink
Whoever puts faith in me just as the scripture has said From deep within him streams of living water will flow
However he said this concerning the spirit which those who put faith in him were about to receive for as yet there was no spirit because Jesus had not yet been glorified
Some in the crowd who heard these words began saying This really is the Prophet
Others were saying This is the Christ But some were saying The Christ is not coming out of Galilee is he
Does the scripture not say that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem the village where David was
So a division over him arose among the crowd
Some of them though wanted to seize him but no one laid his hands on him
Then the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees and the latter said to them Why did you not bring him in
The officers replied Never has any man spoken like this
In turn the Pharisees answered You have not been misled also have you
Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him has he
But this crowd who do not know the Law are accursed people
Nicodemus who had come to him previously and who was one of them said to them
Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing does it
In answer they said to him You are not also out of Galilee are you Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galilee


Then Jesus spoke again to them saying I am the light of the world Whoever follows me will by no means walk in darkness but will possess the light of life
So the Pharisees said to him You bear witness about yourself your witness is not true
In answer Jesus said to them Even if I do bear witness about myself my witness is true because I know where I came from and where I am going But you do not know where I came from and where I am going
You judge according to the flesh I do not judge any man at all
And yet even if I do judge my judgment is truthful because I am not alone but the Father who sent me is with me
Also in your own Law it is written The witness of two men is true
I am one who bears witness about myself and the Father who sent me bears witness about me
Then they said to him Where is your Father Jesus answered You know neither me nor my Father If you did know me you would know my Father also
He spoke these words in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple But no one seized him for his hour had not yet come
So he said to them again I am going away and you will look for me and yet you will die in your sin Where I am going you cannot come
The Jews then began to say He will not kill himself will he Because he says Where I am going you cannot come
He went on to say to them You are from the realms below I am from the realms above You are from this world I am not from this world
That is why I said to you You will die in your sins For if you do not believe that I am the one you will die in your sins
So they began to say to him Who are you Jesus replied to them Why am I even speaking to you at all
I have many things to speak concerning you and to pass judgment on As a matter of fact the One who sent me is true and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world
They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father
Jesus then said After you have lifted up the Son of man then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing of my own initiative but just as the Father taught me I speak these things
And the One who sent me is with me he did not abandon me to myself because I always do the things pleasing to him
As he was saying these things many put faith in him
Then Jesus went on to say to the Jews who had believed him If you remain in my word you are really my disciples
and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
They replied to him We are Abrahams offspring and never have been slaves to anyone How is it you say You will become free
Jesus answered them Most truly I say to you every doer of sin is a slave of sin
Moreover the slave does not remain in the household forever the son remains forever
So if the Son sets you free you will be truly free
I know that you are Abrahams offspring But you are seeking to kill me because my word makes no progress among you
I speak the things I have seen while with my Father but you do the things you have heard from your father
In answer they said to him Our father is Abraham Jesus said to them If you were Abrahams children you would be doing the works of Abraham
But now you are seeking to kill me a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God Abraham did not do this
You are doing the works of your father They said to him We were not born from immorality we have one Father God
Jesus said to them If God were your Father you would love me for I came from God and I am here I have not come of my own initiative but that One sent me
Why do you not understand what I am saying Because you cannot listen to my word
You are from your father the Devil and you wish to do the desires of your father That one was a murderer when he began and he did not stand fast in the truth because truth is not in him When he speaks the lie he speaks according to his own disposition because he is a liar and the father of the lie
Because I on the other hand tell you the truth you do not believe me
Who of you convicts me of sin If I speak truth why is it that you do not believe me
The one who is from God listens to the sayings of God This is why you do not listen because you are not from God
In answer the Jews said to him Are we not right in saying You are a Samaritan and have a demon
Jesus answered I do not have a demon but I honor my Father and you dishonor me
But I am not seeking glory for myself there is One who is seeking and judging
Most truly I say to you if anyone observes my word he will never see death at all
The Jews said to him Now we do know that you have a demon Abraham died also the prophets but you say If anyone observes my word he will never taste death at all
You are not greater than our father Abraham who died are you The prophets also died Who do you claim to be
Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing It is my Father who glorifies me the one who you say is your God
Yet you have not known him but I know him And if I said I do not know him I would be like you a liar But I do know him and am observing his word
Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day and he saw it and rejoiced
Then the Jews said to him You are not yet 50 years old and still you have seen Abraham
Jesus said to them Most truly I say to you before Abraham came into existence I have been
So they picked up stones to throw at him but Jesus hid and went out of the temple


As he was passing along he saw a man who had been blind from birth
And his disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents so that he was born blind
Jesus answered Neither this man sinned nor his parents but it was so that the works of God might be made manifest in his case
We must do the works of the One who sent me while it is day the night is coming when no man can work
As long as I am in the world I am the worlds light
After he said these things he spat on the ground and made a paste with the saliva and he smeared the paste on the mans eyes
and said to him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which is translated Sent Forth And he went and washed and came back seeing
Then the neighbors and those who formerly used to see that he was a beggar began to say This is the man who used to sit and beg is it not
Some were saying This is he Others were saying No but he looks like him The man kept saying I am he
So they asked him How then were your eyes opened
He answered The man called Jesus made a paste and smeared it on my eyes and said to me Go to Siloam and wash So I went and washed and gained sight
At this they said to him Where is that man He said I do not know
They led the formerly blind man to the Pharisees
Incidentally the day that Jesus made the paste and opened his eyes was the Sabbath
So this time the Pharisees also began asking the man how he gained sight He said to them He put a paste on my eyes and I washed and I can see
Some of the Pharisees then began to say This is not a man from God for he does not observe the Sabbath Others said How can a man who is a sinner perform signs of that sort So there was a division among them
And again they said to the blind man What do you say about him since it was your eyes that he opened The man said He is a prophet
However the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had gained sight until they called the parents of the man who could now see
And they asked them Is this your son who you say was born blind How then does he now see
His parents answered We know that this is our son and that he was born blind
But how it is that he now sees we do not know or who opened his eyes we do not know Ask him He is of age He must speak for himself
His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews for the Jews had already come to an agreement that if anyone acknowledged him as Christ that person should be expelled from the synagogue
This is why his parents said He is of age Question him
So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him Give glory to God we know that this man is a sinner
He answered Whether he is a sinner I do not know One thing I do know that I was blind but now I can see
Then they said to him What did he do to you How did he open your eyes
He answered them I told you already and yet you did not listen Why do you want to hear it again You do not want to become his disciples also do you
At this they scornfully told him You are a disciple of that man but we are disciples of Moses
We know that God has spoken to Moses but as for this man we do not know where he is from
The man answered them This is certainly amazing that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes
We know that God does not listen to sinners but if anyone is Godfearing and does his will he listens to this one
From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind
If this man were not from God he could do nothing at all
In answer they said to him You were altogether born in sin and yet are you teaching us And they threw him out
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and on finding him he said Are you putting faith in the Son of man
The man answered And who is he sir so that I may put faith in him
Jesus said to him You have seen him and in fact he is the one speaking with you
He said I do put faith in him Lord And he did obeisance to him
Jesus then said For this judgment I came into this world that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and they said to him We are not blind also are we
Jesus said to them If you were blind you would have no sin But now you say We see Your sin remains


Most truly I say to you the one who does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs in by another way that one is a thief and a plunderer
But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep
The doorkeeper opens to this one and the sheep listen to his voice He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
When he has brought all his own out he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice
They will by no means follow a stranger but will flee from him because they do not know the voice of strangers
Jesus spoke this comparison to them but they did not understand what he was saying to them
So Jesus said again Most truly I say to you I am the door for the sheep
All those who have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers but the sheep have not listened to them
I am the door whoever enters through me will be saved and that one will go in and out and find pasturage
The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance
I am the fine shepherd the fine shepherd surrenders his life in behalf of the sheep
The hired man who is not a shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and fleesand the wolf snatches them and scatters them
because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep
I am the fine shepherd I know my sheep and my sheep know me
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father and I surrender my life in behalf of the sheep
And I have other sheep which are not of this fold those too I must bring in and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock one shepherd
This is why the Father loves me because I surrender my life so that I may receive it again
No man takes it away from me but I surrender it of my own initiative I have authority to surrender it and I have authority to receive it again This commandment I received from my Father
A division again resulted among the Jews because of these words
Many of them were saying He has a demon and is out of his mind Why do you listen to him
Others said These are not the sayings of a demonized man A demon cannot open blind peoples eyes can it
At that time the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem It was wintertime
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon
Then the Jews surrounded him and began to say to him How long are you going to keep us in suspense If you are the Christ tell us plainly
Jesus answered them I told you and yet you do not believe The works that I am doing in my Fathers name these bear witness about me
But you do not believe because you are not my sheep
My sheep listen to my voice and I know them and they follow me
I give them everlasting life and they will by no means ever be destroyed and no one will snatch them out of my hand
What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father
I and the Father are one
Once again the Jews picked up stones to stone him
Jesus replied to them I displayed to you many fine works from the Father For which of those works are you stoning me
The Jews answered him We are stoning you not for a fine work but for blasphemy for you although being a man make yourself a god
Jesus answered them Is it not written in your Law I said You are gods
If he called gods those against whom the word of God cameand yet the scripture cannot be nullified
do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world You blaspheme because I said I am Gods Son
If I am not doing the works of my Father do not believe me
But if I am doing them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father
So they tried again to seize him but he escaped from their reach
And he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first and he stayed there
And many people came to him and began saying John did not perform a single sign but all the things John said about this man were true
And many put faith in him there


Now a man named Lazarus was sick he was from Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha
This was the Mary who poured perfumed oil on the Lord and wiped his feet dry with her hair it was her brother Lazarus who was sick
So his sisters sent a message to him saying Lord see the one you have affection for is sick
But when Jesus heard it he said This sickness is not meant to end in death but is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified through it
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus
However when he heard that Lazarus was sick he actually remained in the place where he was for two more days
Then after this he said to the disciples Let us go into Judea again
The disciples said to him Rabbi just lately the Judeans were seeking to stone you and are you going there again
Jesus answered There are 12 hours of daylight are there not If anyone walks in daylight he does not stumble into anything because he sees the light of this world
But if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him
After he said these things he added Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep but I am traveling there to awaken him
The disciples then said to him Lord if he is sleeping he will get well
Jesus however had spoken about his death But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep
Then Jesus said to them plainly Lazarus has died
and I rejoice for your sake that I was not there so that you may believe But let us go to him
So Thomas who was called the Twin said to his fellow disciples Let us also go so that we may die with him
When Jesus arrived he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem about three kilometers two miles away
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went to meet him but Mary kept sitting at home
Martha then said to Jesus Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
Yet even now I know that whatever you ask God for God will give you
Jesus said to her Your brother will rise
Martha said to him I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day
Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life The one who exercises faith in me even though he dies will come to life
and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all Do you believe this
She said to him Yes Lord I have believed that you are the Christ the Son of God the one coming into the world
When she had said this she went off and called Mary her sister saying privately The Teacher is here and is calling you
On hearing this she got up quickly and went to him
Jesus had not yet come into the village but he was still in the place where Martha had met him
When the Jews who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out they followed her supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there
When Mary arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him she fell at his feet and said to him Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping he groaned within himself and became troubled
He said Where have you laid him They said to him Lord come and see
Jesus gave way to tears
At that the Jews began to say See what affection he had for him
But some of them said Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind man prevent this one from dying
Then Jesus after groaning again within himself came to the tomb It was in fact a cave and a stone was lying against it
Jesus said Take the stone away Martha the sister of the deceased said to him Lord by now he must smell for it has been four days
Jesus said to her Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God
So they took the stone away Then Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said Father I thank you that you have heard me
True I knew that you always hear me but I spoke on account of the crowd standing around so that they may believe that you sent me
When he had said these things he cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come out
The man who had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings and his face was wrapped with a cloth Jesus said to them Free him and let him go
Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary and who saw what he did put faith in him
but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done
So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and said What are we to do for this man performs many signs
If we let him go on this way they will all put faith in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
But one of them Caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them You do not know anything at all
and you have not reasoned that it is to your benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed
He did not say this however of his own originality but because he was high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation
and not only for the nation but also to gather together into one the children of God who were scattered about
So from that day on they conspired to kill him
Therefore Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews but he departed from there to the region near the wilderness to a city called Ephraim and he stayed there with the disciples
Now the Passover of the Jews was near and many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to cleanse themselves ceremonially
They were looking for Jesus and they were saying to one another as they stood around in the temple What is your opinion That he will not come to the festival at all
But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where Jesus was he should report it so that they could seize him


Six days before the Passover Jesus arrived at Bethany where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised up from the dead
So they spread an evening meal for him there and Martha was serving them but Lazarus was one of those dining with him
Then Mary took a pound of perfumed oil genuine nard very costly and she poured it on the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil
But Judas Iscariot one of his disciples who was about to betray him said
Why was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor
He said this though not because he was concerned about the poor but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to steal the money put in it
Then Jesus said Let her alone so that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial
For you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews got to know that he was there and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised up from the dead
The chief priests now conspired to kill Lazarus also
since it was because of him that many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus
The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him and they began to shout Save we pray you Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovahs name the King of Israel
When Jesus found a young donkey he sat on it just as it is written
Have no fear daughter of Zion Look Your king is coming seated on a donkeys colt
These things his disciples did not understand at first but when Jesus was glorified they recalled that these things were written about him and that they did these things to him
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness
This is also why the crowd went to meet him because they heard he had performed this sign
So the Pharisees said among themselves You see that you are not getting anywhere Look The whole world has gone after him
Now there were some Greeks among those who had come to worship at the festival
So these approached Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and they began to request him saying Sir we want to see Jesus
Philip came and told Andrew Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus
But Jesus answered them The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified
Most truly I say to you unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains just one grain but if it dies it then bears much fruit
Whoever is fond of his life destroys it but whoever hates his life in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life
If anyone would minister to me let him follow me and where I am there my minister will be also If anyone would minister to me the Father will honor him
Now I am troubled and what should I say Father save me out of this hour Nevertheless this is why I have come to this hour
Father glorify your name Then a voice came out of heaven I have glorified it and will glorify it again
The crowd that was standing there heard it and began to say that it had thundered Others said An angel has spoken to him
Jesus answered This voice has occurred not for my sake but for your sakes
Now there is a judging of this world now the ruler of this world will be cast out
And yet I if I am lifted up from the earth will draw all sorts of men to myself
This he was really saying to indicate what sort of death he was about to die
Then the crowd answered him We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up Who is this Son of man
So Jesus said to them The light will be among you a little while longer Walk while you still have the light so that darkness does not overpower you whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
While you have the light exercise faith in the light so that you may become sons of light
Jesus said these things and went off and hid from them
Although he had performed so many signs before them they were not putting faith in him
so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled who said Jehovah who has put faith in the thing heard from us And as for the arm of Jehovah to whom has it been revealed
The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said
He has blinded their eyes and has made their hearts hard so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn around and I heal them
Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and he spoke about him
All the same many even of the rulers actually put faith in him but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue
for they loved the glory of men even more than the glory of God
However Jesus called out and said Whoever puts faith in me puts faith not only in me but also in him who sent me
and whoever sees me sees also the One who sent me
I have come as a light into the world so that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness
But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them I do not judge him for I came not to judge the world but to save the world
Whoever disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him The word that I have spoken is what will judge him on the last day
For I have not spoken of my own initiative but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak
And I know that his commandment means everlasting life So whatever I speak I speak just as the Father has told me


Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father Jesus having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end
The evening meal was going on and the Devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon to betray him
So Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God
got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments And taking a towel he wrapped it around his waist
After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him
Then he came to Simon Peter He said to him Lord are you washing my feet
Jesus answered him What I am doing you do not understand now but you will understand after these things
Peter said to him You will certainly never wash my feet Jesus answered him Unless I wash you you have no share with me
Simon Peter said to him Lord wash not only my feet but also my hands and my head
Jesus said to him Whoever has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed but is completely clean And you men are clean but not all of you
For he knew the man who was betraying him This is why he said Not all of you are clean
When now he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on he again reclined at the table and said to them Do you understand what I have done to you
You address me as Teacher and Lord and you are correct for I am such
Therefore if I the Lord and Teacher washed your feet you also should wash the feet of one another
For I set the pattern for you that just as I did to you you should also do
Most truly I say to you a slave is not greater than his master nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him
If you know these things happy you are if you do them
I am not talking about all of you I know the ones I have chosen But this was so that the scripture might be fulfilled The one who was eating my bread has lifted his heel against me
From this moment on I am telling you before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that I am he
Most truly I say to you whoever receives anyone I send receives me also and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me
After saying these things Jesus became troubled in spirit and he bore witness saying Most truly I say to you one of you will betray me
The disciples began to look at one another being at a loss as to which one he was talking about
One of the disciples the one whom Jesus loved was reclining close to Jesus
Therefore Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him Tell us whom he is talking about
So the latter leaned back on the chest of Jesus and said to him Lord who is it
Jesus answered It is the one to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip So after dipping the bread he took it and gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot
After Judas took the piece of bread then Satan entered into him So Jesus said to him What you are doing do it more quickly
However none of those reclining at the table knew why he said this to him
Some in fact were thinking that since Judas was holding the money box Jesus was telling him Buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor
So after he received the piece of bread he went out immediately And it was night
When therefore he had gone out Jesus said Now the Son of man is glorified and God is glorified in connection with him
God himself will glorify him and he will glorify him immediately
Little children I am with you a little longer You will look for me and just as I said to the Jews Where I go you cannot come I now say it also to you
I am giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as I have loved you you also love one another
By this all will know that you are my disciplesif you have love among yourselves
Simon Peter said to him Lord where are you going Jesus answered Where I am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow later
Peter said to him Lord why is it I cannot follow you now I will surrender my life in your behalf
Jesus answered Will you surrender your life in my behalf Most truly I say to you a rooster will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times


Do not let your hearts be troubled Exercise faith in God exercise faith also in me
In the house of my Father are many dwelling places Otherwise I would have told you for I am going my way to prepare a place for you
Also if I go my way and prepare a place for you I will come again and will receive you home to myself so that where I am you also may be
And where I am going you know the way
Thomas said to him Lord we do not know where you are going How can we know the way
Jesus said to him I am the way and the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through me
If you men had known me you would have known my Father also from this moment on you know him and have seen him
Philip said to him Lord show us the Father and it is enough for us
Jesus said to him Even after I have been with you men for such a long time Philip have you not come to know me Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also How is it you say Show us the Father
Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works
Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me otherwise believe because of the works themselves
Most truly I say to you whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I do and he will do works greater than these because I am going my way to the Father
Also whatever you ask in my name I will do this so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son
If you ask anything in my name I will do it
If you love me you will observe my commandments
And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper to be with you forever
the spirit of the truth which the world cannot receive because it neither sees it nor knows it You know it because it remains with you and is in you
I will not leave you bereaved I am coming to you
In a little while the world will see me no more but you will see me because I live and you will live
In that day you will know that I am in union with my Father and you are in union with me and I am in union with you
Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me In turn whoever loves me will be loved by my Father and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him
Judas not Iscariot said to him Lord what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world
In answer Jesus said to him If anyone loves me he will observe my word and my Father will love him and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him
Whoever does not love me does not observe my words The word that you are hearing is not mine but belongs to the Father who sent me
I have spoken these things to you while I am still with you
But the helper the holy spirit which the Father will send in my name that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you
I leave you peace I give you my peace I do not give it to you the way that the world gives it Do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them shrink out of fear
You heard that I said to you I am going away and I am coming back to you If you loved me you would rejoice that I am going to the Father for the Father is greater than I am
So now I have told you before it occurs so that you may believe when it does occur
I will not speak with you much more for the ruler of the world is coming and he has no hold on me
But for the world to know that I love the Father I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do Get up let us go from here


I am the true vine and my Father is the cultivator
He takes away every branch in me not bearing fruit and he cleans every one bearing fruit so that it may bear more fruit
You are already clean because of the word that I have spoken to you
Remain in union with me and I will remain in union with you Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine neither can you unless you remain in union with me
I am the vine you are the branches Whoever remains in union with me and I in union with him this one bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing at all
If anyone does not remain in union with me he is thrown out like a branch and dries up And men gather those branches and throw them into the fire and they are burned
If you remain in union with me and my sayings remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will take place for you
My Father is glorified in this that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples
Just as the Father has loved me so I have loved you remain in my love
If you observe my commandments you will remain in my love just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love
These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full
This is my commandment that you love one another just as I have loved you
No one has love greater than this that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends
You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you
I no longer call you slaves because a slave does not know what his master does But I have called you friends because I have made known to you all the things I have heard from my Father
You did not choose me but I chose you and I appointed you to go and keep bearing fruit and that your fruit should remain so that no matter what you ask the Father in my name he may give it to you
These things I command you that you love one another
If the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it hated you
If you were part of the world the world would be fond of what is its own Now because you are no part of the world but I have chosen you out of the world for this reason the world hates you
Keep in mind the word I said to you A slave is not greater than his master If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have observed my word they will also observe yours
But they will do all these things against you on account of my name because they do not know the One who sent me
If I had not come and spoken to them they would have no sin But now they have no excuse for their sin
Whoever hates me also hates my Father
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did they would have no sin but now they have both seen me and hated me as well as my Father
But this happened in order to fulfill the word written in their Law They hated me without cause
When the helper comes that I will send you from the Father the spirit of the truth which comes from the Father that one will bear witness about me
and you in turn are to bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning


I have said these things to you so that you may not be stumbled
Men will expel you from the synagogue In fact the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has offered a sacred service to God
But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me
Nevertheless I have told you these things so that when the hour for them to happen arrives you will remember that I told them to you
I did not tell you these things at first because I was with you
But now I am going to the One who sent me yet not one of you asks me Where are you going
But because I have told you these things grief has filled your hearts
Nevertheless I am telling you the truth it is for your benefit that I am going away For if I do not go away the helper will not come to you but if I do go I will send him to you
And when that one comes he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
first concerning sin because they are not exercising faith in me
then concerning righteousness because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer
then concerning judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged
I still have many things to say to you but you are not able to bear them now
However when that one comes the spirit of the truth he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak of his own initiative but what he hears he will speak and he will declare to you the things to come
That one will glorify me because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you
All the things that the Father has are mine That is why I said he receives from what is mine and declares it to you
In a little while you will see me no longer and again in a little while you will see me
At that some of his disciples said to one another What does he mean by saying to us In a little while you will not see me and again in a little while you will see me and because I am going to the Father
So they were saying What does he mean by saying a little while We do not know what he is talking about
Jesus knew they wanted to question him so he said to them Are you asking one another this because I said In a little while you will not see me and again in a little while you will see me
Most truly I say to you you will weep and wail but the world will rejoice you will be grieved but your grief will be turned into joy
When a woman is giving birth she has grief because her hour has come but when she has given birth to the child she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born into the world
So you also now you have grief but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take away your joy
In that day you will ask me no question at all Most truly I say to you if you ask the Father for anything he will give it to you in my name
Until now you have not asked for a single thing in my name Ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete
I have spoken these things to you in comparisons The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in comparisons but I will tell you plainly about the Father
In that day you will make request of the Father in my name in saying this I do not mean that I will make request for you
For the Father himself has affection for you because you have had affection for me and have believed that I came as Gods representative
I came as the Fathers representative and have come into the world Now I am leaving the world and am going to the Father
His disciples said See Now you are speaking plainly and are not using comparisons
Now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you By this we believe that you came from God
Jesus answered them Do you believe now
Look The hour is coming indeed it has come when each one of you will be scattered to his own house and you will leave me alone But I am not alone because the Father is with me
I have said these things to you so that by means of me you may have peace In the world you will have tribulation but take courage I have conquered the world


Jesus spoke these things and raising his eyes to heaven he said Father the hour has come Glorify your son so that your son may glorify you
just as you have given him authority over all flesh so that he may give everlasting life to all those whom you have given to him
This means everlasting life their coming to know you the only true God and the one whom you sent Jesus Christ
I have glorified you on the earth having finished the work you have given me to do
So now Father glorify me at your side with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was
I have made your name manifest to the men whom you gave me out of the world They were yours and you gave them to me and they have observed your word
Now they have come to know that all the things you gave me are from you
because I have given them the sayings that you gave me and they have accepted them and have certainly come to know that I came as your representative and they have believed that you sent me
I make request concerning them I make request not concerning the world but concerning those whom you have given me because they are yours
and all my things are yours and yours are mine and I have been glorified among them
I am no longer in the world but they are in the world and I am coming to you Holy Father watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me so that they may be one just as we are one
When I was with them I used to watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me and I have protected them and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction so that the scripture might be fulfilled
But now I am coming to you and I am saying these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves
I have given your word to them but the world has hated them because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world
I do not request that you take them out of the world but that you watch over them because of the wicked one
They are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world
Sanctify them by means of the truth your word is truth
Just as you sent me into the world I also sent them into the world
And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf so that they also may be sanctified by means of truth
I make request not concerning these only but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word
so that they may all be one just as you Father are in union with me and I am in union with you that they also may be in union with us so that the world may believe that you sent me
I have given them the glory that you have given me in order that they may be one just as we are one
I in union with them and you in union with me in order that they may be perfected into one so that the world may know that you sent me and that you loved them just as you loved me
Father I want those whom you have given me to be with me where I am in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the founding of the world
Righteous Father the world has indeed not come to know you but I know you and these have come to know that you sent me
I have made your name known to them and will make it known so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them


After he said these things Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley to where there was a garden and he and his disciples went into it
Now Judas his betrayer also knew the place because Jesus had often met there with his disciples
So Judas brought the detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons
Then Jesus knowing all the things that were going to happen to him stepped forward and said to them Whom are you looking for
They answered him Jesus the Nazarene He said to them I am he Now Judas his betrayer was also standing with them
However when Jesus said to them I am he they drew back and fell to the ground
So he asked them again Whom are you looking for They said Jesus the Nazarene
Jesus answered I told you that I am he So if you are looking for me let these men go
This was to fulfill what he had said Of those whom you have given me I have not lost a single one
Then Simon Peter who had a sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his right ear The name of the slave was Malchus
Jesus however said to Peter Put the sword into its sheath Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me
Then the soldiers and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him
They led him first to Annas for he was the fatherinlaw of Caiaphas who was high priest that year
Caiaphas was in fact the one who had advised the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people
Now Simon Peter as well as another disciple was following Jesus That disciple was known to the high priest and he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest
but Peter was standing outside at the door So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in
The servant girl who was the doorkeeper then said to Peter You are not also one of this mans disciples are you He said I am not
Now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made because it was cold and they were warming themselves Peter also was standing with them and warming himself
So the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching
Jesus answered him I have spoken to the world publicly I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews come together and I said nothing in secret
Why do you question me Question those who have heard what I told them See These know what I said
After he said these things one of the officers who was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said Is that the way you answer the chief priest
Jesus answered him If I said something wrong bear witness about the wrong but if what I said was right why do you hit me
Then Annas sent him away bound to Caiaphas the high priest
Now Simon Peter was standing there warming himself Then they said to him You are not also one of his disciples are you He denied it and said I am not
One of the slaves of the high priest who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off said I saw you in the garden with him did I not
However Peter denied it again and immediately a rooster crowed
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governors residence It was now early in the morning But they themselves did not enter into the governors residence so that they would not get defiled but could eat the Passover
So Pilate came outside to them and said What accusation do you bring against this man
They answered him If this man were not a wrongdoer we would not have handed him over to you
So Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law The Jews said to him It is not lawful for us to kill anyone
This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate what sort of death he was about to die
So Pilate entered the governors residence again and called Jesus and said to him Are you the King of the Jews
Jesus answered Are you asking this of your own originality or did others tell you about me
Pilate replied I am not a Jew am I Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me What did you do
Jesus answered My Kingdom is no part of this world If my Kingdom were part of this world my attendants would have fought that I should not be handed over to the Jews But as it is my Kingdom is not from this source
So Pilate said to him Well then are you a king Jesus answered You yourself are saying that I am a king For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice
Pilate said to him What is truth
After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them I find no fault in him
Moreover you have a custom that I should release a man to you at the Passover So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews
Again they shouted Not this man but Barabbas Now Barabbas was a robber


Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him
And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and clothed him with a purple robe
and they kept coming up to him and saying Greetings you King of the Jews They also kept slapping him in the face
Pilate went outside again and said to them See I bring him outside to you in order for you to know that I find no fault in him
So Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe And Pilate said to them Look The man
However when the chief priests and the officers saw him they shouted To the stake with him To the stake with him Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and execute him for I do not find any fault in him
The Jews answered him We have a law and according to the law he ought to die because he made himself Gods son
When Pilate heard what they were saying he became even more fearful
and he entered the governors residence again and said to Jesus Where are you from But Jesus gave him no answer
So Pilate said to him Are you refusing to speak to me Do you not know that I have authority to release you and I have authority to execute you
Jesus answered him You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above This is why the man who handed me over to you has greater sin
For this reason Pilate kept trying to find a way to release him but the Jews shouted If you release this man you are not a friend of Caesar Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar
Then Pilate after hearing these words brought Jesus outside and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called the Stone Pavement but in Hebrew iGabbathai
Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover it was about the sixth hour And he said to the Jews See Your king
However they shouted Take him away Take him away To the stake with him Pilate said to them Shall I execute your king The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar
Then he handed him over to them to be executed on the stake
So they took charge of Jesus
Bearing the torture stake for himself he went out to the socalled Skull Place which is called iGolgothai in Hebrew
There they nailed him to the stake alongside two other men one on each side with Jesus in the middle
Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the torture stake It was written Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews
Many of the Jews read this title because the place where Jesus was nailed to the stake was near the city and it was written in Hebrew in Latin and in Greek
However the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate Do not write The King of the Jews but that he said I am King of the Jews
Pilate answered What I have written I have written
Now when the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the stake they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts one for each soldier and they also took the inner garment But the inner garment was without a seam being woven from top to bottom
So they said to one another Let us not tear it but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be This was to fulfill the scripture They divided my garments among themselves and they cast lots for my clothing So the soldiers actually did these things
By the torture stake of Jesus however there were standing his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene
So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother Woman see Your son
Next he said to the disciple See Your mother And from that hour on the disciple took her into his own home
After this when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished in order to fulfill the scripture he said I am thirsty
A jar was sitting there full of sour wine So they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop stalk and held it up to his mouth
When he had received the sour wine Jesus said It has been accomplished and bowing his head he gave up his spirit
Since it was the day of Preparation so that the bodies would not remain on the torture stakes on the Sabbath for that Sabbath day was a great one the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man who was on a stake alongside him
But on coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead so they did not break his legs
But one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out
And the one who has seen it has given this witness and his witness is true and he knows that what he says is true so that you also may believe
In fact these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled Not a bone of his will be broken
And again a different scripture says They will look to the one whom they pierced
Now after these things Joseph of Arimathea who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one because of his fear of the Jews asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him permission So he came and took the body away
Nicodemus the man who had come to him in the night the first time also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds
So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices according to the burial custom of the Jews
Incidentally there was a garden at the place where he was executed and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever yet been laid
Because it was the day of Preparation of the Jews and the tomb was nearby they laid Jesus there


On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still dark and she saw that the stone had already been taken away from the tomb
So she came running to Simon Peter and to the other disciple for whom Jesus had affection and she said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him
Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb
The two of them began running together but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first
Stooping forward he saw the linen cloths lying there but he did not go in
Then Simon Peter also came following him and he went into the tomb And he saw the linen cloths lying there
The cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself
Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed
For they did not yet understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead
So the disciples went back to their homes
Mary however kept standing outside near the tomb weeping While she was weeping she stooped forward to look into the tomb
and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying one at the head and one at the feet
And they said to her Woman why are you weeping She said to them They have taken my Lord away and I do not know where they have laid him
After saying this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there but she did not realize that it was Jesus
Jesus said to her Woman why are you weeping Whom are you looking for She thinking it was the gardener said to him Sir if you have carried him off tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away
Jesus said to her Mary On turning around she said to him in Hebrew iRabbonii which means Teacher
Jesus said to her Stop clinging to me for I have not yet ascended to the Father But go to my brothers and say to them I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God
Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples I have seen the Lord And she told them what he had said to her
When it was late that day the first day of the week and the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them May you have peace
After saying this he showed them his hands and his side Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord
Jesus said to them again May you have peace Just as the Father has sent me I also am sending you
After saying this he blew on them and said to them Receive holy spirit
If you forgive the sins of anyone they are forgiven if you retain those of anyone they are retained
But Thomas one of the Twelve who was called the Twin was not with them when Jesus came
So the other disciples were telling him We have seen the Lord But he said to them Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side I will never believe it
Well eight days later his disciples were again indoors and Thomas was with them Jesus came although the doors were locked and he stood in their midst and said May you have peace
Next he said to Thomas Put your finger here and see my hands and take your hand and stick it into my side and stop doubting but believe
In answer Thomas said to him My Lord and my God
Jesus said to him Because you have seen me have you believed Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe
To be sure Jesus also performed many other signs before the disciples which are not written down in this scroll
But these have been written down so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and because of believing you may have life by means of his name


After this Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias He made the manifestation in this way
There were together Simon Peter Thomas who was called the Twin Nathanael from Cana of Galilee the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples
Simon Peter said to them I am going fishing They said to him We are coming with you They went out and got aboard the boat but during that night they caught nothing
However just as day was breaking Jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus
Then Jesus said to them Children you do not have anything to eat do you They answered No
He said to them Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some So they cast it but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish
Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter It is the Lord Now Simon Peter on hearing that it was the Lord put on his outer garment for he was naked and plunged into the sea
But the other disciples came in the small boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not a long way from land only about 90 meters 300 feet away
When they came ashore they saw there a charcoal fire with fish lying on it and bread
Jesus said to them Bring some of the fish you just now caught
So Simon Peter went on board and hauled the net ashore full of big fish 153 of them And though there were so many the net did not burst
Jesus said to them Come have your breakfast Not one of the disciples had the courage to ask him Who are you because they knew it was the Lord
Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and the same with the fish
This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after being raised up from the dead
When they had finished breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you love me more than these He replied to him Yes Lord you know I have affection for you He said to him Feed my lambs
Again he said to him a second time Simon son of John do you love me He replied Yes Lord you know I have affection for you He said to him Shepherd my little sheep
He said to him a third time Simon son of John do you have affection for me Peter became grieved that he asked him the third time Do you have affection for me So he said to him Lord you are aware of all things you know that I have affection for you Jesus said to him Feed my little sheep
Most truly I say to you when you were younger you used to clothe yourself and walk about where you wanted But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another man will clothe you and carry you where you do not wish
He said this to indicate by what sort of death he would glorify God After he said this he said to him Continue following me
Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back on his chest and said Lord who is the one betraying you
So when he caught sight of him Peter said to Jesus Lord what about this man
Jesus said to him If it is my will for him to remain until I come of what concern is that to you You continue following me
So the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die However Jesus did not say to him that he would not die but he said If it is my will for him to remain until I come of what concern is that to you
This is the disciple who gives this witness about these things and who wrote these things and we know that his witness is true
There are also in fact many other things that Jesus did which if ever they were written in full detail I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written
